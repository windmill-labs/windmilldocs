# Launch Week #1

![Launch Week Thumbnail](./launch_week.png)

Welcome to Windmill's first Launch Week!

During the week of November 20, 2023, every day we will announce features that make Windmill even more reliable, faster, and easier to use.

A summary will be updated progressively on this page.

## Day 1 - Flow Builder Copilot

The very first feature of this launch week is Windmill Flow Copilot AI. The Copilot AI can generate the full flow including the code from a few prompts but also do it step-by-step.

It saves time for all users by returning a usable version of the flow in seconds, while leaving room for customization as each step is in the form of code.
For less technical users, it's an opportunity to use Windmill while avoiding back-and-forth with Chat-GPT.

## Day 1 - VS Code Extension

Second annoucement of the day is the Windmill [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill).
It unlocks fully the ability to iterate on your scripts and flows in the comfort of your VS Code editor. It integrates particularly well with the current github/gitlab sync: scripts', flow steps' code and flows' yaml definitions can be directly edited in VS Code while benefitting from the instant preview UI of windmill.
