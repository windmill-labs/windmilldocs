# Launch Week Day 5 - Restartable Flows

<br/>

![Restartable Flows](./restartable_flows.png "Restartable Flows")

<br/>

Last day of our launch week today (we know it's sad). Before saying goodbye, we want to tell you about features that will help you in your ETL, with restartable flows (this article) and S3 integration for data pipelines (link to the blog).

The principle is simple: once the flow is executed (whether in test or deployed), you have the possibility to restart it from any node (step, iteration of a for loop, or branch).

For testing, it's great because you can restart from a specific node without recomputing the flow.

For prod, it's great because you can skip the already completed part of the flow avoiding duplicate actions (in particular, ensure data integrity).

This feature is part of the logic of the different ways to iterate over a flow ([testing the entire flow](/docs/flows/test_flows#test-flow), [only one step](/docs/flows/test_flows#test-this-step), or [up to a certain step](/docs/flows/test_flows#test-up-to-step)).

## How to restart a flow from a given node

In the [flow preview page](/docs/core_concepts/instant_preview), just select a top level node and a "Re-start from X" button will appear at the top, next to "Test flow".
