				The Pro plan is only available in Self-hosted for: <br />- Businesses with less than 10
				employees and $250k revenues<br />- Startups at seed stage <br />- Non-profits & Universities (higher limits
				of workers & users) <br />
				Reach out to contact@windmill.dev to inquiry about exceptions.

				whose duration is less than 1s. For any additional seconds of computation, an additional
				computation is accounted for.
				<br/><br/>
				The number of executions of a flow corresponds to the sum of
				the executions of each step as seconds, considered as one script execution of that same time
				(time in sleep or doing state transition are not accounted). For apps, a backend script
				execution is considered as a script execution. As apps frontend scripts execute on browsers,
				they are not taken into account.
				<br/><br/>
				Jobs are executed on one powerful virtual CPU with 2Gb of
				memory. Most jobs will take less than 200ms to execute.

				For example, 4 workers with 0.25 vCPU each is 1 vCPU. 1 worker with 4 vCPU would count as 4 vCPU.
				But if it only runs for 1h every day, you would divide that by 24.

				Our compute pricing should be linear to the compute cost from your cloud provider.
