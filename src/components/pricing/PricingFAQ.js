				whose duration is less than 1s. For any additional seconds of computation, an additional
				computation is accounted for.
				<br/><br/>
				The number of executions of a flow corresponds to the sum of
				the executions of each step as seconds, considered as one script execution of that same time
				(time in sleep or doing state transition are not accounted). For apps, a backend script
				execution is considered as a script execution. As apps frontend scripts execute on browsers,
				they are not taken into account.
				<br/><br/>
				Jobs are executed on one powerful virtual CPU with 2Gb of
				memory. Most jobs will take less than 200ms to execute.

				are autonomous processes that run one script at a time using the entire cpu and memory available
				to them. Workers serve as the backbone of Windmill as they are responsible for
				executing code.<br/><br/> Each worker on Windmill can run up to 26 millions jobs a month, where
				each job lasts approximatively 100ms. Workers can be horizontally scaled up or down
				depending on needs without any overhead.

	{
		question: 'What is a "native" worker?',
		answer: (
			<span>
				A "native" worker is a normal worker that listens solely for "native" jobs: PostgreSQL,
				MySQL, MSSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, REST which are implemented in windmill natively in our Rust
				backend and thus those jobs have minimal memory footprint and are mostly IO bounds so
				require little vCPUs. In a typical deployment, native workers have limits of 0.1 vCPU and
				200Mb instead of the usual 1vCPU and 2Gb.

	{
		question: 'How is the use of the number of vCPUs and seats reported to Windmill?',
		answer: (
			<span>
				Usage is self-declared. We kindly request that you export your usage stats by sending us an email containing
				the data exported by Windmill through the provided export button at the end of the subscription period.
				<br/><br/>
				We only count the vCPUs reported by your workers as being used.
				So you can simply set limits in the

				The Pro plan is only available in Self-hosted for: <br />- Businesses with less than 10

				of workers & users) <br />
				Reach out to contact@windmill.dev to inquiry about exceptions.
