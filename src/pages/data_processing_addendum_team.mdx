   2. Subprocessor Obligations. Where Windmill authorises a Subprocessor to process Customer Personal Data as described in this section 5, Windmill will enter into a written agreement with each such Subprocessor that contains provisions that are consistent to those contained in this DPA.

   4. If Windmill's compliance with Applicable Privacy Law relating to International Data Transfers is affected by circumstances outside of Windmill's control, including if a legal instrument for International Data Transfers is invalidated, amended, or replaced, then Customer and Windmill will work together in good faith to reasonably resolve such non-compliance. In the event that additional, replacement or alternative Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Standard Contractual Clauses are approved by supervisory authorities, Windmill reserves the right to amend the Agreement and this DPA by adding to or replacing, the Standard Contractual Clauses or UK Standard Contractual Clauses that form part of it at the date of signature in order to ensure continued compliance with Applicable Privacy Law.
   5. Supplementary Measures. In respect of any International Data Transfer, the following supplementary measures shall apply:
      1. As of the date of this Addendum, Windmill has not received any formal legal requests from any government intelligence or security service/agencies in the country to which the Customer Personal Data is being exported, for access to (or for copies of) Personal Data ("Government Agency Requests");
      2. If, after the date of this Addendum, Windmill receives any Government Agency Requests, Windmill shall attempt to redirect the law enforcement or government agency to request that data directly from Customer. As part of this effort, Windmill may provide Customer's basic contact information to the government agency. If compelled to disclose Windmill's Personal Data to a law enforcement or government agency, Windmill shall give Customer reasonable notice of the demand and cooperate to allow Customer to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy unless Windmill is legally prohibited from doing so. Windmill shall not voluntarily disclose Customer Personal Data to any law enforcement or government agency. Customer and Windmill shall (as soon as reasonably practicable) discuss and determine whether all or any transfers of Customer Personal Data pursuant to this Addendum should be suspended in the light of such Government Agency Requests; and
      3. The Customer and Windmill will meet regularly to consider whether: (1) the protection afforded by the laws of the country of Windmill to data subjects whose Personal Data is being transferred is sufficient to provide broadly equivalent protection to that afforded in the EEA or the UK, whichever the case may be; (2) additional measures are reasonably necessary to enable the transfer to be compliant with the Applicable Privacy Laws; and (3) it is still appropriate for Customer Personal Data to be transferred to Windmill, taking into account all relevant information available to the Parties, together with guidance provided by the supervisory authorities.
      4. If Applicable Privacy Laws require the Customer to execute the Standard Contractual Clauses applicable to a particular transfer of Customer Personal Data to Windmill as a separate agreement, Windmill shall, on request of the Customer, promptly execute such Standard Contractual Clauses incorporating such amendments as may reasonably be required by the Customer to reflect the applicable appendices and annexes, the details of the transfer and the requirements of the relevant applicable Data Protection Laws.
      5. (v) If either (i) any of the means of legitimizing transfers of Customer Personal Data outside of the EEA or UK set forth in this Addendum cease to be valid or (ii) any supervisory authority requires transfers of Customer Personal Data pursuant to those means to be suspended, Windmill agrees to amend the means of legitimizing transfers or alternative arrangements with Customer, with effect from the date set out in such notice, amend or put in place alternative arrangements in respect of such transfers, as required by Applicable Privacy Laws.

7. **Cooperation.**
   1. Windmill shall notify Customer of any requests received directly by Windmill from Data Subjects and shall provide to Customer such reasonable assistance as is required for Customer to comply with such Data Subject requests. Windmill shall only respond directly to such Data Subject requests on receiving Customer's written request and consent, provided that (to the extent permitted by Applicable Privacy Law) Customer shall be responsible for all reasonable costs arising from Windmill's provision of such assistance.
   2. To the extent required under Article 28(3) GDPR, Windmill will assist Customer to comply with Articles 35 & 36 GDPR; in particular, upon reasonable request, Windmill will assist Customer to carry out data protection impact assessments and to consult where necessary with data protection authorities.
   3. Following Customer's request, Windmill shall destroy all Customer Personal Data in its possession. This requirement shall not apply to the extent that Windmill is required by any applicable law to retain some or all of the Customer Personal Data, in which case, Windmill shall use reasonable efforts to isolate and protect the Customer Personal Data from any further Processing except to the extent required by such law. Windmill may charge a reasonable fee for assistance under this Section 7\.

8. **Limitation of Liability.** IN NO EVENT SHALL WINDMILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, REPLACEMENT SERVICE OR OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THEORY OF LIABILITY. WINDMILL'S LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING UNDER THIS DPA, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF FEES PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER UNDER THE AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

9. **General.**
   1. Termination. This DPA will terminate automatically upon termination of the Agreement.
   2. Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the Agreement and this DPA, the terms of this DPA will take precedence to the extent of the conflict. In the event of a conflict between the Standard Contractual Clauses and the remaining terms of this DPA, the Standard Contractual Clauses will take precedence to the extent of the conflict. Nothing in this DPA modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses or affects any third party's rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses.

**Annex 2 to the Data Processing Addendum**

**Windmill Security Policy and Privacy Guidelines**

**Technical and Organizational Security Measures**

**Measures of pseudonymisation and encryption of customer data** We decouple user code and workflow state, meaning that no customer code is executed in the Windmill SaaS environment. All workflow data access happens on the customer side. At their discretion, customers may encrypt their data on the customer side before it is sent to Windmill Technologies' systems, with no loss of functionality. All customer data is encrypted at rest with industry-standard encryption.

**Measures for ensuring ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services** Windmill Technologies enforces the rule of least privilege for all systems, based on employee role. Access lists are audited quarterly. Access to all systems is through SSO with MFA enabled, with access deleted or suspended on termination of employment. Windmill Technologies does not use customer workflow data for any purpose other than delivery of service.

**Measures for ensuring the ability to restore the availability and access to customer data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident** Windmill Technologies maintains a business continuity and disaster recovery plan that is tested yearly.

**Processes for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures in order to ensure the security of the processing** Windmill Technologies conducts regular external audits (SOC 2 Type II) to ensure ongoing effectiveness. Windmill Technologies conducts a yearly risk assessment, which drives the prioritization of initiatives. Windmill Technologies conducts an external full-scope pentest at least annually.

**Measures for user identification and authorisation** Windmill Technologies routes all authentication through corporate-controlled SSO, with MFA enabled. Windmill Technologies enforces the rule of least privilege for all systems, based on employee role.

**Measures for the protection of data during transmission** Windmill Technologies ensures encryption in transit for all communications between customers and the service itself using industry standard protocols. Windmill Technologies encrypts all customer data in transit inside our service using industry-standard mutually authenticated TLS. Windmill Technologies supports private network connections to the service.

**Measures for the protection of data during storage** Windmill Technologies encrypts all data at rest with cloud native encryption for ephemeral and persistent data stores using cloud provider's object storage. Additionally, customers may encrypt their data before it is sent to Windmill systems with no loss of functionality.

**Measures for ensuring physical security of locations at which customer data are processed** Physical access to customer data processing locations is the responsibility of cloud providers. Windmill Technologies validates semi-annually that all subprocessors have sufficient physical security controls, including access controls, visitor logs, video security and alarm systems, backup power, and environmental monitoring.

**Measures for ensuring events logging** Windmill Technologies logs relevant events to a central security information and event management system. Windmill employees monitor events, and automated alerts are sent to 24/7 oncall.

**Measures for ensuring system configuration, including default configuration** Windmill Technologies manages all deployments through automated, repeatable processes driven by infrastructure as code tooling.

**Measures for internal IT and IT security governance and management** Windmill Technologies ensures effective internal IT and IT security governance and management by implementing an information security management program that is informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.

**Measures for certification/assurance of processes and products** Windmill Technologies ensures assurance of products and processes by conducting third party audits of the service according to the 2018 Description Criteria for a Description of a Service Organization's System in a SOC 2 Type II Report as issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Upon request Windmill Technologies will share or provide evidence that a third party audit was conducted.

**Measures for ensuring data minimisation** Windmill Technologies processes only that data which is relevant and necessary for the provision of services.

**Measures for ensuring data quality** Windmill Technologies ensures data quality by ensuring that such details are up to date, reviewing data regularly, and following data deletion practices.

**Measures for ensuring limited data retention** Windmill Technologies retains customer data currently in process until the end of contract; this is necessary to the service we provide. Customer data that is no longer in processing (e.g. kept for historical purpose) are deleted automatically, based on a retention setting configurable by the customer. All customer data is deleted upon contract termination. Backups are retained for 30 days.

**Measures for ensuring accountability** Windmill Technologies ensures accountability through logging of access activity. Such logs are retained indefinitely, and can be reviewed to ensure that any access is proportionate and appropriate. Windmill Technologies does not allow non-employees access to customer data or production systems. All Windmill Technologies employees are required to abide by our data protection policies, any violation of which will result in disciplinary procedures.

**Measures for allowing data portability and ensuring erasure** Windmill Technologies supports migration of all data in customer's accounts out of Windmill Cloud and into any other Windmill system, including OSS instances hosted by the customer. Customers can configure their own retention period for historical data, and can halt any currently running processing.
