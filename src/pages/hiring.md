# Hiring - Join us!

Windmill is part of the YC S22 batch.

## Open positions

windmill.dev is looking for its first key people. In particular, we are looking
for the following kind of profiles:

- [Head of BD & Sales](#head-of-bd--sales) - (Remote)
- Founding Engineer (Paris/Remote): If that is of interest, you might grow as
  Head of Engineering/CTO as the engineering team scale, but you can also chose
  to stay as an IC with significant impact if you prefer. You fit one or ideally
  a mix of those 3 profiles:
  - Founding Solutions Engineer - Head of Solutions
  - Founding Software Engineer
  - Founding DevOps Engineer
- Graduate program/Internship: You just graduated and are looking to learn how
  to grow BD, build a startup or write quality software for OSS in a remote
  environment for a period of 3 to 6 months. You will have the opportunity to
  join the team at the end.

If you are interested to join the adventure. Apply by sending an email at
hiring@windmill.dev or on
<https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/windmill/jobs/WlSHAed-founding-engineer>.
Be sure to mention which role you are interested in if any applicable. You may
also define your own role!

We are **FULLY REMOTE** forever but we will organize off-sites on a regular
basis. If you happen to live in Paris, we have a small office in the 15th
quarter.

### Head of BD & Sales

windmill.dev is a SaaS that can be sold (through dual-licensing) not only to
individual and teams but also to enterprises, either as self-hostable software
or hosted on our cloud. You own the relationship with those companies, including
the sales process and the acquisition funnel.

Furthermore, windmill.dev can potentially grow as a tool for consultancy shops
or as a automation consultancy itself, it is a plus if you are interested or
have related experience.
