It manages network infrastructure, cloud, datacenter, and unified communications for 150 enterprise customers globally, including government agencies, hospitals, schools, and corporations. The company needed a scalable and decentralized automation infrastructure to gradually onboard these customers to self-service automation. Today, 14 customer-facing teams actively use Windmill for network automation, with the remaining customers in the onboarding pipeline. The core challenge was finding a platform with the right architecture and economics to support their growth and decentralization journey.

<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
	Ben Willems, Product Owner of Axians' Automation Team, faced a scaling challenge: how to provide automation capabilities to 150 enterprise customers without massive upfront costs.

		"We manage Software Defined Networking for customers like government agencies, schools, hospitals, and large corporations. They trust us with their entire network infrastructure. We want to enable our engineers to build automation scripts themselves in a managed, secure, and compliant environment—so they can focus on solving complex problems rather than repetitive tasks."

	The mission: become a data-driven managed service provider by gathering information, transforming it into insights, and acting on those insights with smart automations. The challenge was scaling this approach. As customers onboarded gradually, each brought different processes and requirements. They needed a platform with default automations that could be customized for each customer while remaining centrally orchestrated and scalable.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
	The infrastructure needed to support this growth pattern:
</p>
<ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 ml-4">
	<li>Multi-tenant architecture - Separate isolated environments for each customer</li>
	<li>Gradual scaling - Start with early adopters, expand as adoption spreads</li>
	<li>Usage-based economics - Pay for what you use, not fixed enterprise licensing</li>
	<li>Compliance-ready - ISO and IC certifications require auditing and logging</li>
</ul>
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4 mt-4">
		Axians evaluated over 10 platforms including <a href="https://kestra.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">Kestra</a>, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">Ansible Automation Platform</a>, and <a href="https://n8n.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">n8n</a>. Ansible Automation Platform was technically solid but economically impossible for gradual scaling. Device-based licensing meant paying for hundreds to thousands of licenses per customer network, just for the right to run automations. Combined with development costs and platform hosting, the total cost of ownership was prohibitively high with an ROI timeline measured in years, not months.

<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">

			Multi-tenant architecture that scales with adoption

			Windmill's workspace model and remote worker architecture solved Axians' core challenge: start with early adopters, scale as customers onboard, and execute scripts decentrally—all without massive upfront costs.

		<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
			Ben's platform team manages Windmill hosted in Azure Kubernetes Services. Customer teams—network engineers managing specific client accounts—build and maintain their own automations within their workspaces. The platform team provides infrastructure; the customer teams own their automation scripts.
		</p>
		<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
			This model scales efficiently. Axians doesn't need to hire developers to build automation for every customer. Early adopters build scripts, other teams adopt them, and the automation library grows organically. Critically, customer-facing teams understand their clients' specific needs and requirements better than any central team could—reducing alignment overhead and ensuring automations work correctly the first time.

		<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
			For the 14 customer teams actively using the platform, the results are dramatic. Network deployments that took 4 hours now complete in 5-10 minutes.

			Axians avoided massive upfront costs of enterprise platforms by choosing usage-based pricing. As they scale from 14 to 150 customer teams, costs grow proportionally rather than in large licensing steps. Critically, customer-specific workspaces preserve the ability to tailor automations per client—delivering on their motto of "best of ICT with a human touch" while maintaining economic viability.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
	Axians demonstrates how managed service providers can scale automation-as-a-service using Windmill's architecture. Starting with 14 active customers and growing toward 150, they needed infrastructure that could scale gradually without massive upfront costs.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
	Windmill's workspace isolation provides multi-tenancy, usage-based pricing enables proportional growth, and audit logs ensure compliance. For MSPs scaling automation across dozens or hundreds of customers, this architecture makes the economics work. After evaluating 10+ platforms, Windmill scored 8.9 out of 10—nearly double the next competitor.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
	The lesson for MSPs: choose platforms that support your growth trajectory, not just your current state.
