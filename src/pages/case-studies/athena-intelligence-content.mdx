	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
		<a href="https://www.athenaintel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">Athena Intelligence</a> builds an AI agent platform for enterprise automation. The company serves the advisory and consulting industry, along with financial services and healthcare. All these sectors have heavy compliance requirements where private cloud or on-premise deployment is often mandatory. Without deployment flexibility, entire market segments would be inaccessible.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The problem</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
	Brendon Geils, founder of Athena Intelligence, spent years evaluating workflow orchestration platforms. The blocker was always deployment: could it run in a customer's environment? In an on-premise data center? Embedded into another product?
</p>
<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 py-2 my-6">
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 italic mb-2">
		"I had tested every product on the market. There was not very many products that were willing to be deployed on private clouds, self-hosted, on-prem, embedded."
	</p>
	<cite className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
		— Brendon Geils, Founder
	</cite>
</blockquote>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
	Most workflow companies built SaaS products where multi-tenancy was baked into their business model. Self-hosting was an afterthought. But for Athena, this blocked access to their entire target market. Major consulting firms won't route sensitive client data through third-party SaaS. Healthcare companies face HIPAA requirements. Financial services have data sovereignty policies.
</p>
<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 py-2 my-6">
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 italic mb-2">
		"We would never go with a vendor that wouldn't make that possible in one, two, three years time because it's like putting all your eggs in a basket and then at scale you can actually never deploy that basket into the facilities that we want."
	</p>

</blockquote>
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
		The workflow engine was foundational. Getting it wrong meant either abandoning regulated markets or facing expensive re-architecture later. <a href="https://hatchet.run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">Hatchet</a> was too unstable. <a href="https://airflow.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">Airflow</a> was too low-level without a UI. Most platforms treated self-hosting as an afterthought with poor documentation.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The solution</h2>
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
		Windmill supported cloud, <Link to="https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">self-hosted</Link>, on-premise, and embedded deployments as core capabilities, not afterthoughts. The <a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-blue-500 dark:text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-600 dark:hover:text-blue-300 underline cursor-pointer">open-source</a> foundation meant Athena could verify deployment feasibility before committing, which is critical for enterprise IT reviews.
	</p>
<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 py-2 my-6">
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 italic mb-2">
		"Everything worked out of the box. It was easy for me to learn. The technical people on our team took to it really quickly."

		— Brendon Geils
	</cite>
</blockquote>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
	For a platform company, reliability was existential. When infrastructure embedded in a customer-facing product fails, it's Athena's reputation on the line.
</p>
<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 py-2 my-6">
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 italic mb-2">
		"When I get woken up at night because something is on fire, it's never due to Windmill. Windmill is actually one of the most stable parts of our business, so we can quickly focus on identifying and fixing the real issue."

</blockquote>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
	The documentation covered edge cases other platforms hadn't anticipated: network segmentation, identity provider integration, resource constraints. This reduced the deployment friction that kills enterprise deals.

The agent helps write the code, the script is saved in Windmill, and it becomes a new tool the agent invokes automatically.

<blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-500 pl-4 py-2 my-6">
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 italic mb-2">
		"Our primary use case is the script capability. Our agent has a set of built-in tools, but whenever we need something new, customers build a custom script. The agent can help them write the code, and then that script becomes a new tool in the agent's toolkit."

</blockquote>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
	For enterprise customers, Windmill runs embedded within Athena's platform in their own infrastructure. Windmill is invisible infrastructure underneath, executing scripts within their security perimeter.

<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">The result</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
	Athena is now deploying to major regulated enterprise customers that require private cloud infrastructure and would be inaccessible with a SaaS-only platform.
</p>

	After nearly a year in production, Windmill serves dozens of customer organizations running 24/7 automation. The infrastructure has proven rock-solid.

<section>
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Why this matters for platform companies</h2>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
	For companies serving regulated industries, deployment flexibility determines market access. Athena spent years searching for a workflow platform that could unlock these markets. Not for more features, but for architectural flexibility that could scale across deployment environments while maintaining production reliability.
</p>
<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
	The lesson for platform companies and ISVs: choose foundational technology based on the markets you want to access three years from now, not just the customers you can sign today.

<section>
<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
		Athena Intelligence's story reveals a simple truth: for platform companies targeting regulated industries, deployment flexibility isn't a feature, it's market access. SaaS-only tools lock you out of audit firms, financial services, and healthcare. Self-hosting as an afterthought creates deployment friction that kills enterprise deals.
	</p>
	<p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
		Windmill's open-source foundation, production stability, and enterprise-ready documentation solved this. After years evaluating workflow platforms, Athena found infrastructure they could confidently build on and deploy wherever customers required. Today, they're winning enterprise deals their competitors can't even pursue.
