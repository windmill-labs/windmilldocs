# UI editor

Full-code apps can be created and edited directly in the Windmill web interface, without using the [CLI](../5_cli_workflow/index.mdx).

## Overview

The in-browser editor provides:

- **File tree**: navigate and manage frontend files
- **Code editor**: edit frontend and backend code with syntax highlighting
- **Runnables panel**: create, edit and configure backend runnables from a sidebar
- **Data table configuration**: whitelist data tables from the UI
- **Preview**: test your app without deploying

## Creating a full-code app

From your Windmill workspace:

1. Click the dropdown menu next to `+ App`
2. Select `Import app in React/Vue/Svelte`
3. Choose your framework or upload an existing project

## Editing frontend files

The file tree on the left shows all frontend files. Click a file to open it in the code editor. You can:

- Create new files and folders
- Rename and delete files
- Edit code with syntax highlighting and autocompletion

## Managing backend runnables

The runnables panel on the right lists all backend runnables. From here you can:

- Add new inline scripts in any supported language
- Reference existing workspace scripts or flows
- Configure static input fields
- View and edit runnable code

## Data table configuration

Configure which [data tables](../4_data_tables/index.mdx) your app can access:

1. Open the data configuration panel
2. Select a datatable from your workspace
3. Whitelist specific tables
4. Optionally set a schema name

## Preview and testing

Click the preview button to test your app in the browser. The preview runs your bundled frontend code and connects to Windmill's backend for runnable execution.

## When to use the UI editor vs CLI

| Scenario | Recommended |
|----------|-------------|
| Quick edits to an existing app | UI editor |
| New app from scratch | CLI (`wmill app new`) |
| Complex frontend with many dependencies | CLI (`wmill app dev`) |
| Team collaboration with git | CLI + [git sync](../../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx) |
