# Deployment

Full-code apps can be deployed via the [CLI](../5_cli_workflow/index.mdx) or the [UI editor](../6_ui_editor/index.mdx). This page covers deployment options and configuration.

## Deploy via CLI

Push your app to Windmill:

```bash
wmill sync push
```

The CLI reads `raw_app.yaml`, bundles your frontend code, uploads backend runnables and deploys the app. See [CLI workflow](../5_cli_workflow/index.mdx) for the full push flow.

## Deploy via UI

From the in-browser editor, click the deploy button to save and publish your app.

## Public apps

Make your app accessible without authentication by setting `public: true` in `raw_app.yaml`:

```yaml
summary: "Public dashboard"
public: true
policy:
  execution_mode: anonymous
  triggerables: {}
  triggerables_v2: {}
```

Public apps are accessible at their app URL without requiring a Windmill login. See [public apps](../../apps/8_public_apps.mdx) for more details.

## Custom paths

Admins can set a custom URL path for an app:

```yaml
custom_path: "my-dashboard"
```

The app will then be accessible at `https://<instance>/apps/custom/my-dashboard`.

## Execution policy

The `policy.execution_mode` field controls how backend runnables are executed:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `publisher` | Runnables execute as the app owner (the user who deployed the app). Users don't need direct permissions on the underlying scripts. |
| `anonymous` | Runnables execute with the permissions of the viewer. Used for public apps or when you want per-user access control. |

### Triggerables

The `triggerables` and `triggerables_v2` fields in the policy are auto-generated when deploying. They map each runnable to its execution configuration. You generally don't need to edit these manually — they are populated during push/deploy.

## Versioning

Each deployment creates a new version of the app. The version counter increments on every update. Previous versions are retained and can be accessed through the API.

## CI/CD integration

Full-code apps work with Windmill's [git sync](../../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx) and [deploy to prod](../../advanced/12_deploy_to_prod/index.mdx) workflows:

1. Develop locally and commit your `.raw_app/` directory to git
2. Use `wmill sync push` in CI to deploy to a staging workspace
3. Promote to production using workspace-to-workspace deployment
