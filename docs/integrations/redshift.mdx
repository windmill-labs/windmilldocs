# Amazon Redshift integration

Amazon [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service in the cloud provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
It is designed to handle large-scale data storage and complex query processing for data analysis.

Windmill provides a framework to support [PostgreSQL](./postgresql.md) databases which makes it compatible with Amazon Redshift. To start using your Redshift instance on Windmill just follow the same steps as for a PostgreSQL database.

Please refer to the [SQL Getting started section](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/5_sql_quickstart/index.mdx) for more details.
