# DuckDB integration

[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) is an open-source, in-process SQL OLAP database management system designed for fast analytical query workloads.

Windmill supports seamless integration with DuckDB, allowing you to manipulate data from S3 (csv, parquet, json), BigQuery, PostgreSQL, and MySQL.
