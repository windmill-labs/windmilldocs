The [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) integration is done through OAuth. You just need to sign in from your Google account on your browser. The access will be automatically saved to the workspace as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx).

Find some pre-set interactions with Google Calendar on the [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/gcal).

Feel free to create your own Google Calendar scripts on [Windmill](../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.mdx).
