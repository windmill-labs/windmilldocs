# Slack Integration

Learn how to integrate Slack with Windmill. There are two ways to build
interactions between the two: run code on Windmill by a Slack command or use the
Slack API directly from Windmill. In this guide, we'll cover both approaches.

## Action on Windmill from Slack

The goal here is to be able to invoke a Windmill Script from Slack, by using
`/windmill` command. First, you need to be a **workspace admin**. Then you
should go to
[workspace settings page](https://app.windmill.dev/workspace_settings) and
select the "Slack Command" tab. On there, click "Connect to Slack".

:::info Self-hosted

The Slack integration is done through OAuth. On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.md), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.md).

:::

<video
className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
controls

/>

<br/>

Slack will ask you to allow Windmill to access your workspace. Click "Allow".

:::note

At the time of writing, Slack cautiones that Windmill is not an approved app. We
are working on getting the app approved but you can safely ignore it for now.

:::

### Using commands on Slack

Once you allow access, you will be redirected to the Slack settings in Windmill.
We'll create a command handler Script first, so let's click "Create a script to
handle slack command".

You will be navigated to the Script editor. Give your script a name
(e.g. `slack_command_handler`), a short summary (e.g. "Slack command handler"). You'll get to [this](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/slack/1405/example-of-responding-to-a-slack-command-slack) template:

```typescript
export async function main(
  response_url: string,
  text: string,
) {
  const x = await fetch(response_url, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ text: `ROGER ${text}` }),
  });
  const username = await Deno.env.get('WM_USERNAME')
  console.log(`user = ${username}`)
```

After the Script is deployed, navigate back to the
[Slack settings][wm-slack-settings], choose the "Script" option for adding a
command handler and select your newly created Script.

![Connected settings](../assets/integrations/slack-3-connected.png)

Congratulations! You've just created a Slack command handler. Now you can use
the `/windmill` command in your Slack workspace to trigger the Script. Try it
out with `/windmill foo` and you should get back `ROGER foo`. Go ahead and
customize the Script to your needs.

![Use the Windmill command](../assets/integrations/slack-5-slack-command.png.webp)

You won't be able to have Slack interact with your [resources](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) and [variables](../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) before adding them to the `slack` [group](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#groups) that was automatically created by Windmill after you set up your Slack workspace on Windmill. Tutorial below.

<details>
  <summary>How to let Slack use your resources and variables:</summary>

To give the permission, go to "Resources" (and "Variables") menu, click on `Share`, `Group` and pick `slack`.

<br/>

![Share to slack group](../assets/integrations/slack-10-slack_group.png.webp)

<br/>

One simplier way to handle permissions is to host resources and variables on a [folder](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders) that is part of the [group](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#groups) `slack`.

<br/>

<br/>

![Share folder to group](../assets/integrations/slack-12-folder_to_group.png.webp)


</details>

### Monitor who ran the command

You can see who ran the `/windmill` command by going to the [Runs page][wm-runs]
on Windmill. The runs will be permissioned through the `g/slack` global group.

![Run info](../assets/integrations/slack-6-run-info.png)

You can also monitor and permission it from within the script leveraging the [contextual variable](../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx#contextual-variables) `WM_USERNAME` that will get the value of the Slack user.

For example our script:

```ts
export async function main(
  response_url: string,
  text: string,
) {
  const x = await fetch(response_url, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ text: `ROGER ${text}` }),
  });
  // This part:
  const username = await Deno.env.get('WM_USERNAME')
  console.log(`user = ${username}`)
}
```

will console.log `user = username`, username being the Slack username.

### Handle multiple commands

We cover in a [subsequent article](/blog/handler-slack-commands) how to manage multiple commands from your slackbot using [branches](../flows/13_flow_branches.md) and a text parser.

		href="/blog/handler-slack-commands#control-the-slackbot-by-getting-username"
	/>
</div>

## Action on Slack from Windmill

The second way to make Slack and Windmill interact is through scripts triggered from Windmill to the Slack API. In other words, our goal here is to allow Windmill Scripts
acting on Slack on your behalf.

Lets navigate to the [Resources][wm-resource] page and click "Add a
resource/API".

:::info

You can read more about Resources in the documentation [here][docs-resource].

:::

![Create Slack resource](../assets/integrations/slack-7-resources.png.webp)

Select the `slack` Resource Type from the "OAuth APIs" list and by clicking
"Connect", you will be redirected to the Slack accounted associated with your browser. Click "Allow" to let
Windmill access your Slack workspace. Once that's done, you will be redirected
back to Windmill, where you can name your Slack Resource and Save it.

:::note

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.md), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.md).

:::

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    controls
    src="/videos/slack_through_windmill.mp4"
    alt="Connect Slack to Windmill"
/>

<br/>

Your connection is made! Now you can trigger the Slack API from Windmill.

For example, try [this script](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/slack/1284/send-message-to-channel-slack) to send a message to a channel.

```typescript
import { WebClient } from "https://deno.land/x/slack_web_api@1.0.0/mod.ts";
type Slack = {
  token: string
}

export async function main(
  text: string,
  channel: string,
  slack: Slack
) {
  const web = new WebClient(slack.token);

  await web.chat.postMessage({
    channel,
    text,
  });
}
```
