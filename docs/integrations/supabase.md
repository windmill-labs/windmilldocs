# Supabase Integration

Learn how to connect to your [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project from Windmill Scripts, Flows and Apps.

:::info

This tutorial assumes that you already have a <a href='https://app.windmill.dev/user/login' rel="nofollow">Windmill</a> account and a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project. If you don't, visit the [Windmill documentation](/docs/getting_started/how_to_use_windmill) or the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.com/docs) to find out more.

## Through Postgres Protocol

You can execute queries on Supabase through the regular Postgres protocol.

1. Sign-up to Supabase's <a href="https://app.supabase.com/sign-up" rel="nofollow" >Cloud App</a> or [Self-Host](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting) it.

2. [Create a new Supabase project](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started).

3. From Windmill, on the [Resources](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) menu click on "Add a resource". Pick "postgresql" and "Add a Supabase DB". This will lead you to a Supabase page where
   you need to pick your organization. Then on Windmill pick a database, fill with database password and that's it.

## Through Supabase API

### Get the API keys

In order to make authenticated requests to the database, you'll need your API
key and the URL of your endpoint from Supabase. To get these, select your
project, navigate to the `Project Settings` page and select `API` from the menu.
You'll find the URL and 2 keys here.

![API settings](../assets/integrations/sb-1-1-settings.png.webp)

As the description says, the access level of the `public` key will be controlled
by the policies you add and the `secret` key will bypass all of them. You can
safely use the `service_rolesecret` `secret` key in Windmill because it'll never be sent to users
directly.

### Create a resource

To safely use secret values throughout Windmill, you can save them in
`reources`. We are regularly updating the list of approved resources but if you
want an integration to be supported by Windmill directly, please submit a new
`resource type` on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/resources).

**Navigate to the <a href="https://app.windmill.dev/resources" rel="nofollow">Resources page</a> page**
![Resources page](../assets/integrations/sb-2-1-resources.png.webp)

**Click "Add a resource/API"** ![Resource selector](../assets/integrations/sb-2-2-drawer.png.webp)

**Search for `Supabase` and select the resource type**
![Resource selector](../assets/integrations/sb-2-3-search.png.webp)

**Enter the API key and the URL from Supabase and click "Save"**
![Resource selector](../assets/integrations/sb-2-4-resource.png.webp)

### Use the resource

You can reference the type of a Supabase resource in a script the following way:

```ts
// To get the latest supported resource types,
// check for the latest version of the Windmill Deno
// package at https://deno.land/x/windmill/mod.ts
type Supabase = {
	url: string;
	key: string;
};

export async function main(auth: Supabase) {
	// Function contents
}
```

You can find more examples and premade Supabase scripts on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/supabase).
