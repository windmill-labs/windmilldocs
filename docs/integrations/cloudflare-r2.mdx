# Cloudflare Integration

[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) is a cloud object storage service for data-intensive applications.

Cloudflare's API follows the same schema as any S3 compatible API.

:::info Windmill S3 integration

You can link a Windmill workspace to an S3 bucket and use it as source and/or target of your processing steps seamlessly, without any boilerplate.

<br/>

See [Object Storage for Large Data](../core_concepts/11_persistent_storage/large_data_files.mdx) for more details.

## Add an S3 Resource

To integrate Cloudflare to Windmill, you need to save the following elements as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

Here is [the information](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/api/) on where to find the required details:

Find some pre-set interactions with S3 on the [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/s3).

Feel free to create your own S3 scripts on [Windmill](../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.mdx).

## Connect your Windmill workspace to your S3 bucket or your Azure Blob storage

Once you've created an S3 or Azure Blob resource in Windmill, you can use Windmill's native integration with S3 and Azure Blob, making it the recommended storage for large objects like files and binary data.

## S3/Azure for Python Cache & Large Logs

For large logs storage (and display) and cache for distributed Python jobs, you can connect your instance to a bucket.
