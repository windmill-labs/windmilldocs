# Cloudflare integration

[Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/r2/) is a cloud object storage service for data-intensive applications.

Instance and workspace object storage are different from using S3 resources within scripts, flows, and apps, which is free and unlimited. This is what is [described in this page](#add-a-s3-resource).

At the [workspace level](../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#workspace-object-storage), what is exclusive to the [Enterprise](/pricing) version is using the integration of Windmill with S3 that is a major convenience layer to enable users to read and write from S3 without having to have access to the credentials.

Additionally, for [instance integration](../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#instance-object-storage), the Enterprise version offers advanced features such as large-scale log management and distributed dependency caching.

Cloudflare's API follows the same schema as any S3 compatible API.

## Add a S3 resource

To integrate Cloudflare to Windmill, you need to save the following elements as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

Find some pre-set interactions with S3 on the [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/s3).

Feel free to create your own S3 scripts on [Windmill](../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.mdx).

## Workspace object storage

Once you've created an S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage resource in Windmill, you can use Windmill's native integration with S3, Azure Blob, or GCS, making it the recommended storage for large objects like files and binary data.

![Workspace object storage Infographic](../core_concepts/11_persistent_storage/s3_infographics.png "Workspace object storage")

The workspace object storage is exclusive to the [Enterprise](/pricing) edition. It is meant to be a major convenience layer to enable users to read and write from S3 without having to have access to the credentials.

		href="/docs/core_concepts/object_storage_in_windmill#workspace-object-storage"
	/>
</div>

## Instance object storage

Under [Enterprise Edition](/pricing), instance object storage offers advanced features to enhance performance and scalability at the [instance](../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx) level. This integration is separate from the [Workspace object storage](#workspace-object-storage) and provides solutions for large-scale log management and distributed dependency caching.
