# LinkedIn integration

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a professional networking and career development platform.

The LinkedIn integration is done through OAuth. You just need to sign in from your LinkedIn account on your browser. The access will be automatically saved to the workspace as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx).

Your resource can be used [passed as parameters](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#passing-resources-as-parameters-to-scripts-preferred) or [directly fetched](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#fetching-them-from-within-a-script-by-using-the-wmill-client-in-the-respective-language) within [scripts](../script_editor/index.mdx), [flows](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) and [apps](../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
