# Integrations on Windmill

Integrations are key on Windmill as they allow databases (internal & external) and service providers to interact.

Using Windmill, integrations are referred to as [resources and resource types](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx). Each Resource has a Resource Type (RT for short) - for example MySQL, MongoDB, Slack, etc. - that defines the schema that the resource needs to implement.

We already have pre-set integrations (or resource types), the list is available on our [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/resources), [using Windmill](../intro.mdx) (most up-to-date version), and at the end of this article.

How resources and resource types work in Windmill:

## Using integrations

Interacting with an integration means using a resource, see the dedicated doc part:

## You feel one integration is missing?

### Create one

You can [create a resource type](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#create-a-resource-type). Use the "Add Property" button to add a field to the resource type. You can specify constraints for the field (a type, making it mandatory, specifying a default, etc). You can also view the schema by toggling the "As JSON" option.

Once you're comfortable with the new integration, we would be super grateful if you could [share it on Hub](../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md).

You will be asked to fill Name, Integration (the corresponding service it interacts with) and Schema (the JSON Schema of the Resource Type).

Verified Resource types on the Hub are directly added to the list of available Resource types on each new Windmill instance synced with the Hub.

## List of integrations

### OAuth APIs

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx), integrating OAuth APIs will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx).
