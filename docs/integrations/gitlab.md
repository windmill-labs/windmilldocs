# GitLab Integration

The [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) integration is done through OAuth. You just need to sign in from your GitLab account on your browser. The access will be automatically saved to the workspace as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

On [self-hosted instances](../advanced/1_self_host/index.md), integrating an OAuth API will require [Setup OAuth and SSO](../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.md).

Find some pre-set interactions with Gitlab on the [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/gitlab).

Feel free to create your own Gitlab scripts on [Windmill](../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.mdx).
