# MySQL Integration

To integrate [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) to Windmill, you need to save the following elements as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

## MySQL as a Script Language

MySQL can be used as a script language using the [MySQL driver for Deno](https://deno.land/x/mysql@v2.11.0) in Typescript.

Otherwise, [Python libraries](https://github.com/PyMySQL/PyMySQL) and [Deno](https://deno.com/manual@v1.28.3/node/how_to_with_npm/mysql2) are also suggesting mysql2 from npm.

Find some pre-set interactions with MySQL on the [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/mysql).

Feel free to create your own MySQL scripts on [Windmill](../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.mdx).
