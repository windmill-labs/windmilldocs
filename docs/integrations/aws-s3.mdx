# Amazon S3 integration

[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a cloud storage service.

Instance and workspace object storage are different from using S3 resources within scripts, flows, and apps, which is free and unlimited. This is what is [described in this page](#add-a-s3-resource).

At the [workspace level](../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#workspace-object-storage), what is exclusive to the [Enterprise](/pricing) version is using the integration of Windmill with S3 that is a major convenience layer to enable users to read and write from S3 without having to have access to the credentials.

Additionally, for [instance integration](../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#instance-object-storage), the Enterprise version offers advanced features such as large-scale log management and distributed dependency caching.

Windmill provides a unique [resource type](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/42/) for any API following the typical S3 schema.

## Add a S3 resource

Amazon S3's API follows the same schema as any S3 compatible API.

To integrate Amazon S3 to Windmill, you need to save the following elements as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

| Property  | Type    | Description                  | Default | Required        | Where to Find                                      | Additional Details                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Workspace object storage

Once you've created an S3, Azure Blob, or Google Cloud Storage resource in Windmill, you can use Windmill's native integration with S3, Azure Blob, or GCS, making it the recommended storage for large objects like files and binary data.

![Workspace object storage Infographic](../core_concepts/11_persistent_storage/s3_infographics.png "Workspace object storage")

The workspace object storage is exclusive to the [Enterprise](/pricing) edition. It is meant to be a major convenience layer to enable users to read and write from S3 without having to have access to the credentials.

		href="/docs/core_concepts/object_storage_in_windmill#workspace-object-storage"
	/>
</div>

## Instance object storage

Under [Enterprise Edition](/pricing), instance object storage offers advanced features to enhance performance and scalability at the [instance](../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx) level. This integration is separate from the [Workspace object storage](#workspace-object-storage) and provides solutions for large-scale log management and distributed dependency caching.
