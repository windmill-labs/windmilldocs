[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)'s API follows the same schema as any S3 compatible API.

To integrate Amazon S3 to Windmill, you need to save the following elements as a [resource](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

| Property  | Type    | Description                  | Default | Required        | Where to Find                                      | Additional Details                                                                                                                                                                                |
