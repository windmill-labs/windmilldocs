# S3 APIs integrations

S3 is a cloud-based object storage service designed to store and retrieve any amount of data.

Windmill provides a unique [resource type](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/42/) for any API following the typical S3 schema.

:::info Windmill S3 integration

You can link a Windmill workspace to an S3 bucket and use it as source and/or target of your processing steps seamlessly, without any boilerplate.

See [Object Storage for Large Data](../core_concepts/11_persistent_storage/large_data_files.mdx) for more details.

Your resource can be used [passed as parameters](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#passing-resources-as-parameters-to-scripts-preferred) or [directly fetched](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#fetching-them-from-within-a-script-by-using-the-wmill-client-in-the-respective-language) within [scripts](../script_editor/index.mdx), [flows](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) and [apps](../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).

Find some pre-set interactions with S3 on the [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/integrations/s3).

Feel free to create your own S3 scripts on [Windmill](../getting_started/00_how_to_use_windmill/index.mdx).

## Connect your Windmill workspace to your S3 bucket or your Azure Blob storage

Once you've created an S3 or Azure Blob resource in Windmill, you can use Windmill's native integration with S3 and Azure Blob, making it the recommended storage for large objects like files and binary data.
