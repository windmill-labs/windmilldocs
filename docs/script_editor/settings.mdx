# Settings

Each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth.

![Script Metadata](../assets/code_editor/script_metadata.png 'Script Metadata')

## Path

**Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consists of the [script's owner](../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx#permissions-and-access-control), and the script's name.
The owner can be either a user, or a group of users ([folder](../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
