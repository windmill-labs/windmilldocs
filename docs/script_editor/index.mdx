# Script Editor

In Windmill, Scripts are the basis of all major features (they are the steps of [flows](../getting_started/6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx), [linked to apps components](../apps/3_app-runnable-panel.mdx), or can be [run as standalone](../getting_started/8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx)).

A Script can be written in:
[TypeScript (Deno)](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx),
[Python](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/2_python_quickstart/index.mdx),
[Go](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/3_go_quickstart/index.mdx),
[Bash](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/4_bash_quickstart/index.mdx) or
[SQL](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/5_sql_quickstart/index.mdx). Its
two most important components are the input [JSON Schema](../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md)
specification and the [code content](../code_editor/index.mdx).

Python and Go Scripts also have an
auto-generated lockfile that ensure that executions of the same Script always
use the exact same set of versioned dependencies. The code must always have a
main function, which is its entrypoint when executed as an individual serverless
endpoint or a [Flow](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) module:

TypeScript:

  ```typescript
  async function main(param1: string, param2: { nested: string }) {
  	...
  }
  ```

Python:

  ```python
  def main(param1: str, param2: dict, ...):
  	...
  ```

Go:

  ```go
  func main(x string, nested struct{ Foo string \`json:"foo"\` }) (interface{}, error) {
  	...
  }
  ```

Bash:

There is no main needed for Bash. The body is executed and the args are passed directly.
