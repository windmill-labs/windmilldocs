# Script Editor

In Windmill, Scripts are the basis of all major features (they are the steps of [flows](../getting_started/6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx), [linked to apps components](../apps/3_app-runnable-panel.mdx), or can be [run as standalone](../getting_started/8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx)).

A Script can be written in:
[TypeScript (Deno & Bun)](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx),
[Python](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/2_python_quickstart/index.mdx),
[Go](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/3_go_quickstart/index.mdx),
[Bash](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/4_bash_quickstart/index.mdx) or
[SQL](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/5_sql_quickstart/index.mdx). Its
two most important components are the input [JSON Schema](../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md)
specification and the [code content](../code_editor/index.mdx).

![Script languages](../../static/images/script_languages.png 'Script languages')

Python and Go Scripts also have an
auto-generated lockfile that ensure that executions of the same Script always
use the exact same set of versioned dependencies. To fit Windmill's execution model, the code must always have a
main function, which is its entrypoint when executed as an individual serverless
endpoint or a [Flow](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) module and typed parameters used to infer the script's inputs and [auto-generated UI](../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx):

<TabItem value="Go" label="Go" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```go
  func main(x string, nested struct{ Foo string \`json:"foo"\` }) (interface{}, error) {
  	...
  }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Bash" label="Bash" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

There is no main needed for Bash. The body is executed and the args are passed directly.

## Workflows as Code

One way to write distributed programs that execute distinct jobs is to use [flows](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) that chain scripts together.

Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program directly in your script. This is known as workflows as code.
