# Mini map

The mini map allows you to view the flow in a mini map. You can quickly navigate to a specific step by clicking on the step in the mini map. You can also insert a step by clicking on the plus icon in the mini map. A step can be deleted by clicking on the cross icon when hovering over the step.

When selected, the step will be highlighted.

## For loops

For loops are represented by a single step in the mini map. However, a for loop has sub-steps.The sub-steps will be displayed in the mini map shifted to the right. When a for loop is deleted, all the sub-steps will be deleted as well.
