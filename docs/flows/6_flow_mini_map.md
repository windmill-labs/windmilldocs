# Mini map

The mini map allows you to view the flow in a mini map. You can quickly navigate to a specific step by clicking on the step in the mini map. You can also insert a step by clicking on the plus icon in the mini map. A step can be deleted by clicking on the cross icon when hovering over the step. When selected, the step will be highlighted.

The mini map and the settings menu are separated by an interactive divider, so that you can increase one of them when you need.

## For loops

For loops are represented by a single step in the mini map. However, a for loop has sub-steps.The sub-steps will be displayed in the mini map shifted to the right. When a for loop is deleted, all the sub-steps will be deleted as well.

## Branches

Branches are represented by a single step in the mini map. The branches are displayed as boxes in the mini map. When a branch step is deleted, all the branches will be deleted as well. You can add a new branch by clicking on the `Add branch` button.
