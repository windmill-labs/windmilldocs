# Trigger Scripts

Triggers are special actions that run periodically given a [schedule](../core_concepts/1_scheduling/index.md).
By default, adding a trigger will set the schedule to 15 minutes.

:::info

Check our pages dedicated to [Scheduling](../core_concepts/1_scheduling/index.md) and [Triggering flows](../getting_started/9_trigger_flows/index.mdx).

:::

Triggers scripts are designed to pull data from an external source and return all of the new items since the last run, using [states](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#states).

This type of Flow is meant to be scheduled regularly to reduce latency when reacting to new events. It will **trigger the rest of the Flow once per new item that is returned**. If there are no new items, the flow will be skipped.

:::tip

Think of this as someone who checks the mailbox every day. If there is a new
letter, they will continue to process it - open and read it - and if there is no
new letter, they won't do anything.

The key part is that opened letters are not placed back in the mailbox. In
Windmill, **a Trigger Script has the job to keep track of what's processed and
what's not**.

Flows can be scheduled through the Flow UI using a CRON expression and then
activating the schedule as seen in the image below.

![Schedule Scripts](../getting_started/9_trigger_flows/schedule-flow.png.webp)

Examples of trigger scripts include:

- [Trigger everytime a new item text on HackerNews match at least one mention](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/hackernews/1301/trigger-everytime-a-new-item-text-on-hackernews-match-at-least-one-mention-hackernews)
- [Notify of new Github repo stars](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/github/1208/notify-of-new-github-repo-stars-github)
- [Check new uploaded files on Google Drive](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/gdrive/1457/get-new-files-gdrive)

The following TypeScript code is an example of the first module of a Flow that
checks for new documents in a MongoDB collection on a regular schedule. In this
case we query documents that were created after a specific time, expressed with
a timestamp. The timestamp is stored with the help of Windmill's built-in
[state functions](../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#state) and is
updated in each run.

```ts
import { getState, type Resource, setState } from 'https://deno.land/x/windmill/mod.ts';
import { MongoClient, ObjectId } from 'https://deno.land/x/atlas_sdk/mod.ts';

type MongodbRest = {
	endpoint: string;
	api_key: string;
};

export async function main(
	auth: MongodbRest,
	data_source: string,
	database: string,
	collection: string
) {
	const client = new MongoClient({
		endpoint: auth.endpoint,
		dataSource: data_source,
		auth: { apiKey: auth.api_key }
	});
	const documents = client.database(database).collection(collection);
	const lastCheck = (await getState()) || 0;
	await setState(Date.now() / 1000);
	const id = ObjectId.createFromTime(lastCheck);
	return await documents.find({ _id: { $gt: id } });
}
```
