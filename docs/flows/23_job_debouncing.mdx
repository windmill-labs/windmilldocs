# Job debouncing

Job debouncing prevents redundant job executions by canceling pending jobs with identical characteristics when new ones are submitted within a specified time window. This feature helps optimize resource usage and prevents unnecessary duplicate computations.

Job debouncing is a [Cloud plans and Pro Enterprise Self-Hosted](/pricing) only feature.

Debouncing can be configured from the Settings menu. When enabled, pending jobs with matching tags or arguments are canceled when new jobs arrive within the debounce window.

The debouncing feature involves two key parameters:
- [Time window in seconds](../core_concepts/22_job_debouncing/index.mdx#time-window-in-seconds)
- [Custom debounce key](../core_concepts/22_job_debouncing/index.mdx#custom-debounce-key)

## Flow debouncing

From the Flow Settings Advanced menu, select "Debouncing" and define the debounce time window and optionally a custom debounce key.

This is particularly useful for flows triggered by webhooks or events that may fire multiple times in quick succession.

## Debouncing for scripts within flows

Individual steps within a flow can have their own debounce settings. This can be configured in the `Advanced` menu of each step, under the "Runtime" tab in the "Debouncing" section.

This allows you to prevent redundant executions of specific steps that might be triggered multiple times as a flow executes.
