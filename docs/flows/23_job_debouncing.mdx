Job debouncing is a [Cloud plans and Pro Enterprise Self-Hosted](/pricing) only.

Debouncing can be set from the Settings menu. When jobs with matching characteristics are submitted within the debounce window, pending jobs are automatically canceled in favor of the newest one.

The Job debouncing operates globally and across flow runs. It involves two key parameters:
- [Time window in seconds](../core_concepts/22_job_debouncing/index.md#time-window-in-seconds)
- [Custom debounce key](../core_concepts/22_job_debouncing/index.md#custom-debounce-key)
