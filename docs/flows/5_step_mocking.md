# Step Mocking

Step mocking allows faster iteration while building flows. When a step is mocked, it will immediately return the mocked value without performing any computation.

On a step, go to the `Advanced` menu and pick the "Mock" tab.

"Enable step mocking" and customize the Mocked Return value.

:::tip Cache for steps

The [cache for steps feature](./4_cache.md) allows you to cache the results of a step for a specified number of seconds, thereby reducing the need for redundant computations when re-running the same step with identical input.
