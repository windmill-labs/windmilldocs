# Early Return

It is possible to define a node at which the flow will return at for [sync endpoints](../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx#synchronous). The rest of the flow will continue asynchronously.

Useful when some webhooks need to return extremely fast but not just the uuid (define first step as [early stop](./2_early_stop.md)) or when the expected return from the webhook doesn't need to the full flow being computed.

Webooks can be found on the flow page once [deployed](../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx).
