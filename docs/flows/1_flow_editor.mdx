# Flow Editor

Windmill's Flow Editor allows you to build flows with a low-code builder.

:::info Workflows

A workflow is a series of connected tasks, events, or processes that occur automatically to achieve a specific goal. These tasks are organized as a sequence of actions or steps: [scripts](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx) in the case of Windmill.
