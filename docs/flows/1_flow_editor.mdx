# Flow Editor

Windmill's Flow Editor allows you to build flows with a low-code builder.

Workflows are graphs ([DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)) that represent the dependencies between steps.

The goal of an orchestrator or workflow engine is to execute the steps on different workers that respect that graph's dependencies, and pass the required data defined in the steps' inputs while applying parallelism when possible.

In Windmill, each step is code with a main function in TypeScript, Python, Go, PHP, Bash or raw queries to databases.

Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program. This is known as workflows as code.
