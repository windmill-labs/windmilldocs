:::info Scripts in Windmill

[Scripts](../0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx) are sequences of instructions that automates tasks or performs specific operations. In Windmill, they are hosted on workspaces.

## On-demand triggers

### Auto-generated UIs

Windmill automatically generates user interfaces (UIs) for scripts and flows based on their parameters.

By analyzing the main function parameters, it creates an input specification in the JSON Schema format, which is then used to render the UI. Users do not need to interact with the JSON Schema directly, as Windmill simplifies the process and allows for optional UI customization.

	src="/videos/auto_generated_uis.mp4"
/>

<br />

This feature is also usable directly in the script editor to test a script in the making:

	controls
	src="/videos/ui_from_script_editor.mp4"

		href="/docs/core_concepts/auto_generated_uis"
	/>
</div>

### Customized UIs with the App Editor

Windmill provides a WYSIWYG app editor. It allows you to build your own UI with drag-and-drop components and to connect your data to scripts and flows in minutes.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/app_editor_fast.mp4"
/>

	<DocCard
		title="App Editor"
		color="orange"
		description="Detailed section on Windmill's App Editor."
		href="/docs/apps/app_editor"
	/>
</div>

You can also [automatically generate](../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) a dedicated app to execute your script.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/cowsay_app.mp4"
/>

### Trigger Scripts from Flows

Flows are basically sequences of scripts that execute one after another or [in parallel](../../flows/13_flow_branches.md#branch-all).

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"

		title="Flow Editor"
		color="teal"
		description="Detailed section on Windmill's Flow Editor."
		href="/docs/flows/flow_editor"
	/>
</div>

### Workflows as Code

Flows are not the only way to write distributed programs that execute distinct jobs. Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program within a [Python](../0_scripts_quickstart/2_python_quickstart/index.mdx) or [TypeScript](../0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx) script. This is known as workflows as code.

	<DocCard
		title="Workflows as Code"
		description="Automate tasks and their flow with only code."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/workflows_as_code"
	/>
</div>

### Schedule the Execution of a Script

Windmill allows you to schedule scripts using a user-friendly interface and control panel, **similar to [cron](https://crontab.guru/)** but with more features.

You can create schedules by specifying a script or flow, its arguments, and a CRON expression to control the execution frequency, ensuring that your tasks run automatically at the desired intervals.

	<DocCard
		title="Schedules"
		description="Scheduling allows you to define schedules for Scripts and Flows, automatically running them at set frequencies."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/scheduling"
	/>
</div>

### CLI (Command Line Interface)

The `wmill` CLI allows you to interact with Windmill instances right from your terminal.

	/>
</div>

## Triggers from external events

### Trigger from API

Windmill provides a RESTful API that allows you to interact with your Windmill instance programmatically.

In particular, the operation [run script by path](https://app.windmill.dev/openapi.html#/operations/runScriptByPath) is designed to trigger a script by its path, passing the required arguments.

It's an efficient way to run a script from another script.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="OpenAPI"
		description="Interact with Windmill."
		href="https://app.windmill.dev/openapi.html"
	/>
</div>

### Webhooks

In Windmill, webhooks are autogenerated for each Script and Flow, providing either asynchronous or synchronous execution modes.

These webhooks accept incoming HTTP requests, allowing users to easily trigger their Windmill scripts and flows from external services by simply sending a POST request to the appropriate authentified webhook URL (requires passing a [token](../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx#webhook-specific-tokens) as Bearer or query arg). Their purpose is to have the script run when it receives an input from its associated webhook.

Using webhooks, you could also trigger a script from other scripts.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Webhooks"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows from webhooks."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/webhooks"
	/>
</div>

#### Webhooks: Trigger Scripts from Slack

One use case of webhooks is [building a Slackbot with Windmill](/blog/handler-slack-commands).

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/generated_email.mp4"
/>

<br />

Windmill uses Slack to trigger scripts and flows by establishing Slackbots and creating specific commands. By connecting Slack with Windmill, parsing incoming Slack commands, and leveraging Windmill workflows, operational teams can trigger complex automations directly from Slack.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Slack Integration"
		description="Learn how to integrate Slack with Windmill."
		href="/docs/integrations/slack"
	/>
</div>

#### Webhooks: Trigger Scripts from Emails

One use case of webhooks is [triggering scripts via inbound emails using Mailchimp](../../integrations/mailchimp_mandrill.md).

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/trigger_mandrill.mp4"
/>

<br />

Windmill leverages [Mailchimp Mandrill](https://mailchimp.com/en/features/transactional-email/)'s capabilities to initiate scripts and flows via email-triggered events. By parsing inbound emails and routing the content to Windmill through webhooks, scripts or flows are activated, enabling automation based on email content or just their arrival.

	<DocCard
		title="Mailchimp Mandrill Integration"
		description="Learn how to integrate Mailchimp Mandrill with Windmill."
		href="/docs/integrations/mailchimp_mandrill"
	/>
</div>

### Scheduling + Trigger Scripts

A particular use case for schedules are [Trigger Scripts](../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx).

Trigger scripts are used in [Flows](../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) and are designed to pull data from an external source and return all of the new items since the last run, without resorting to external webhooks. A trigger script is intended to be used with [schedules](../../core_concepts/1_scheduling/index.mdx) and [states](../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#states) (rich objects in JSON, persistent from one run to another) in order to compare the execution to the previous one and process each new item in a [for loop](../../flows/12_flow_loops.md). If there are no new items, the flow will be skipped.

You could set your script in a flow after a Trigger script to have it run only when new data is available.
