# Apps Quickstart

Welcome to the Apps Quickstart! This document will provide you with 95% of the knowledge on building apps, in a few minutes.

Although Windmill provides **auto-generated UIs to scripts and flows**, you can build your own internal applications designed to your needs.

Windmill applications are customized UIs to interact with datasources (web, internal, data providers, etc). They are a great way to have non-technical users interact with custom-made workflows.

[Here](https://hub.windmill.dev/apps/3/crm) is an example of an app built with Windmill.

In short, what you need to remember about apps:
- they work on a **what-you-see-is-what-you-get basis**
- you can connect apps and components to **datasources**
- components can be **empowered by Windmill [scripts](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/getting_started/scripts_quickstart/typescript)**

To create your first app, you could pick one from our [Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/apps) and fork it. Here, we're going to build our own app from scratch, step by step.

From [Windmill](https://app.windmill.dev/user/login), click on `+ App`, and let's get started!

### Toolbar

Before jumping in, you should decide if you want to build a **Desktop** or a **Mobile** app. Just clik on the appropriated icon on top.

While we are there, know that you can either go with **centered** content or rather display **full page width**.

Switch from **Editor** to **Preview** mode to take a step back on what you're building.

### Components

The App editor works on a drag-and-drop basis. From the right-side menu, click on a component to **create** it on the [canvas](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/apps/app_canvas/), **move** it maintaining a click on it and **delete** it clicking on `Delete component` at the bottom of the `Settings` tab. You can resize your components by dragging the **resize** handler on the bottom-right corner.

If you have numerous components you might need to **Anchor** some of them to have them unmovable by other components.

Check out all of our components at [this page](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/apps/app_component_library) or (better) directly from the app editor. Know that **we can quickly add components to the librairy**, just mention your suggestions on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB) channel.


### Empower components with scripts

The beauty of Windmill App editor is the integrations of scripts & workflows to components. On the bottom of the app editor, you can find the **[Runnable](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/apps/app-runnable)** editor. It allows you to create, edit or manage the scripts or flows linked to components (Runnables), and background scripts.

:::tip Add a script to a component

The following video showcases how to call a script either from workspace/hub or add it directly inline.

/>

The **[Ouputs](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/apps/app_outputs)** of each component can be found on the left side menu. Each of them is associated with a component (see the component id).

![Apps outputs](./apps_ouputs.png)


**Inputs can be connected to any output**: on a component click on `Connect` and associate inputs to outputs.

![Connect inputs to outputs](./connect_inputs_outputs.png)


At any time, have a look at your app's **Inputs** associated with each component on the dedicated `App inputs` tab.

### Tailor the look of your app

At the **component level**, on the `Settings` tab, configure the style of each component (color, size, label, etc.) either directly on boxes or in Custom CSS (on the `Settings` tab).

![Cutomize components](./customize_component.png)


At the **app level**, you can give a harmonized style to your app with CSS. On the `CSS` tab, give details either in boxes or in JSON.

### Time to test

While building you app, you can try each component clicking on refresh button.

You can do a refresh all for the whole app with the refesh button on top of the canvas, or even schedule automatic refesh.

![Refresh app](./refresh_app.png)

For possible bugs, there is a `Debug Runs` tab to review past runs with details per component.

### Then what?

When you're done with the editing of your app, `Save` the current version to the relevant users/folders with a proper and explicit name.

Once it's saved, it's ready to use! You can also `Publish` it, or even `Publish to Hub` and export it in JSON or Hub compatible JSON from the `â‹®` tab.
