# Getting Started

Windmill is an [open-source](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill) platform to build all your internal tools (endpoints, workflows, UIs) through the combination of code (in Typescript, Python, Go, Bash, SQL or any docker image) and low code builders.

Windmill can be self-hosted or used on a cloud version.

### Self-Host Windmill

You can choose to self-host Windmill on your own infra.

Run it at scale on kubernetes using our [helm charts](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts) or use a docker-compose for smaller setups.

### Use Windmill Cloud

Windmill provides a <a href="https://app.windmill.dev/" rel="nofollow">Cloud App</a>.

You can sign-up using your GitHub, GitLab, Google, Microsoft Single Sign-On. No Credit Cards required and we will spare your inbox.

Any user will be provided with 1,000 monthly executions from our [Community Plan](/pricing) and added to the Demo workspace. From there, users can create workspaces for free and create scripts, workflows and UIs.

And if you feel like it, [upgrade](/pricing) for unlimited executions.

### Local Development

Windmill has its [own integrated development environment](../../code_editor/index.mdx), but you can also develop and run scripts locally, both with self-hosted and cloud instances.

From a [VS Code extension](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx) to a solid setup for [deploying to production](../../advanced/12_deploy_to_prod/index.mdx) using [Git sync](../../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx), Windmill offers several ways to interact locally with the platform.

## Where to Start?

Windmill is a feature-rich developer platform to build endpoints, cron jobs, workflows & UIs. Each of these features can be used standalone.

However the 3 core layers of Windmill, namely Scripts, Flows and Apps are complementary. Scripts are the smallest "unit" of abstraction and workflows and UIs rely on them.

- Have a look at our quickstarts (on [Scripts](../../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx), [Flows](../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx) or [Apps](../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx)) that give an introduction on how to build your first ones.
- Check how to [trigger scripts](../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) and [flows](../9_trigger_flows/index.mdx) to get an idea of what you could do with Windmill.
- Play with Windmill: [Cloud App](#use-windmill-cloud) or [Self-Hosting](#self-host-windmill). Our cloud Demo workspace showcases some speaking examples.
- Browse [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/) and explore templates shared by the community.
