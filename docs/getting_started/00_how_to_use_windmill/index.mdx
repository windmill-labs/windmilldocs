# Getting started with Windmill

Windmill is a fast, **<a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill">open-source</a>** workflow engine and developer platform. It's an alternative to the likes of Retool, Superblocks, n8n, Airflow, Prefect, Kestra and Temporal, designed to **build comprehensive internal tools** (endpoints, workflows, UIs). It supports coding in TypeScript, Python, Go, PHP, Bash, C#, SQL and Rust, or any Docker image, alongside intuitive low-code builders.

## Development options

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
Windmill supports development directly within its [built-in IDE](../../code_editor/index.mdx), tailored for creating scripts, workflows, and UIs efficiently.

### Local development
Prefer your own setup? No problem. Windmill integrates smoothly with local environments, including a [VS Code extension](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx) and tools for [Git-based deployment to production](../../advanced/12_deploy_to_prod/index.mdx).
