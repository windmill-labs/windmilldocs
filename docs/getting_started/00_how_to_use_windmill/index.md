# How to Use Windmill

Windmill is fully [open-source](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill). Therefore, we want it to be as easy to use as possible.

## Self-host Windmill

You can choose to self-host Windmill on your own servers.

[Windmill's GitHub repository](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill) contains all the necessary files to
run Windmill locally, or to self-host it.

We encourage Docker-based deployments, and provide a `docker-compose` file to
help you get started.

For detailed information, follow the **[Self Host Windmil tutorial](https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host/)**.


## Use Windmill Cloud


Windmill provides a **[Cloud App](https://app.windmill.dev/user/login)** that everyone can use.

You can sign-up using your GitHub, GitLab, Google, Microsoft or email. No Credit Cards required and we will spare your inbox.


Any user will be provided with 1,000 monthly executions from our [Free plan](https://www.windmill.dev/pricing/) and added to the Demo workspace. From there, users can create workspaces for free and create scripts, workflows and UIs.

And if you feel like it, [upgrade](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/misc/upgrade/) for unlimited executions.
