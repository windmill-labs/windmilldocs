# Rest / GraphQL Quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in [Rest](https://restfulapi.net/) & [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

/>

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Script Editor"
		description="All the details on scripts."
		href="/docs/script_editor"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Triggering Scripts"
		description="Trigger flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events."
		href="/docs/getting_started/trigger_scripts"
	/>
</div>

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- [Code](#code).
- [Settings](#settings): settings & metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [jsonschema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md) of its inputs (inferred from its signature).

When stored in a code repository, those 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.ts` and `<path>.script.yaml`.

Below is a simple example of a script built in Rest with Windmill:

```ts
export async function main() {
	const res = await fetch('https://api.supabase.com/v1/organizations', {
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer <your_supabase_token>`,
			'Content-Type': 'application/json'
		}
	});
	return res.json();
}
```

## Settings

![New script](./create_script_rest.png.webp)

As part of the settings menu, each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth.

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consist of the
  [script's owner](../../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default.
- **Language** of the script.
- **Description** is where you can give instructions through the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx)
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown.
- **Script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx) or [Error Handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx).

This menu also has additional settings, such as:

- **[Concurrency limits](../../../script_editor/concurrency_limit.mdx)** enable defining concurrency limits for scripts and inline scripts within flows to prevent exceeding the API Limit of the targeted API.
- **[Worker group tag](../../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx)** to assign scripts to specific worker groups (such as nodes with GPU acceleration).
- **[Cache](../../../core_concepts/24_caching/index.md)** to cache the results for each possible inputs for a given time.
- **[Dedicated Workers](../../../core_concepts/25_dedicated_workers/index.mdx)** to run the script on, to run the script at native speed. Only available on enterprise edition and for the Bun language.

Now click on the code editor on the left side.

## Code

Windmill provides an online editor to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side [previews the UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can preview that UI, provide input values, and [test your script](#instant-preview--testing) there.

### Rest

As we picked `Rest` for this example, Windmill provided some boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```ts
// Fetch-only script, no imports allowed but benefits from a dedicated highly efficient runtime

export async function main(example_input: number = 3) {
	// "3" is the default value of example_input, it can be overriden with code or using the UI
	const res = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/${example_input}`, {
		headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
	});
	return res.json();
}
```

Rest scripts are in fact [TypeScript](../1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx) fetches. They support all the normal signatures of normal TypeScript but only [stdlib](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/stdlib.h) javascript and the fetch operations.
[Imports](../../../advanced/6_imports/index.md) are not allowed.

Fetches can also be done through a regular TypeScript in Windmill, but opting for dedicated Rest scripts
benefits from a highly efficient runtime.

Replace the `<jsonplaceholder>` URL with the API endpoint of your choice and customize the headers object according to your fetch requirements.

REST scripts benefit from the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) capabilities of any Windmill script.
The arguments of the `main` function are used for generating 1. the input spec of the Script,
and 2. the frontend that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

This is also a way to have users fill [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) or [variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) through the auto-generated UI. The UI is available in the script editor to [test your code](../../../core_concepts/23_instant_preview/index.mdx):

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/rest_supabase.mp4"
/>

<br />

> In the example above, a custom resource is declared as a parameter of the main function. It will be asked by the user through the auto-generated UI and used directly in the script (here for the bearer token).

If the endpoint is and HTTPS endpoint exposing custom certificate, the fetch will fail. Custom certificates can be trusted using the `DENO_CERT` env variable (see [Deno official documentation](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/getting_started/setup_your_environment#environment-variables))

<br />

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Instant Preview & Testing"
		description="On top of its integrated editors, Windmill allows users to see and test what they are building directly from the editor, even before deployment."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/instant_preview"
	/>
</div>

### GraphQL

As we picked `GraphQL` for this example, Windmill provided some boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```ts
query($name1: String, $name2: Int, $name3: [String]) {
	demo(example_name_1: $name1, example_name_2: $name2, example_name_3: $name3) {
		example_name_1,
		example_name_2,
		example_name_3
	}
}
```

The query itself is similar to any GraphQL query.

To trigger each GraphQL script, an input named 'api' will be required. This is a [GraphQL resource](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/112/graphql) defined by the JSON schema:

```js
{
    "type": "object",
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "required": [
        "base_url"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "base_url": {
            "type": "string",
            "format": "uri",
            "default": "",
            "description": ""
        },
        "bearer_token": {
            "type": "string",
            "default": "",
            "description": ""
        },
        "custom_headers": {
            "type": "object",
            "description": "",
            "properties": {},
            "required": []
        }
    }
}
```

[Resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) are rich objects in JSON that allow to store configuration and credentials. They can be saved, named, and shared within Windmill to control and streamline the execution of GraphQL scripts.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Resources and Resource Types"
		description="Resources are structured configurations and connections to third-party systems, with Resource Types defining the schema for each Resource."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/resources_and_types"
	/>
</div>

The arguments of the query will be used for generating 1. the input spec of the Script,
and 2. the frontend that you see when running the Script with an [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx).
Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize the UI in later steps (but not change the input type).

The UI is available in the script editor to [test your code](../../../core_concepts/23_instant_preview/index.mdx):

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/graphql_example.mp4"
/>

<br />

> In the example above, a [GraphQL resource](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/112/graphql) is used with details on base URL and bearer token. Also was used the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) to fill the argument `login`.

## Customize UI

From the Settings menu, the "Generated UI" tab lets you customize the script's arguments.

The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"

</div>

## Run!

We're done! Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the [Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx) button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Note that Scripts are versioned in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely [identified by a hash](../../../script_editor/versioning.mdx)

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs](../../../core_concepts/5_monitor_past_and_future_runs/index.mdx) menu on
the left.

![Run hello world in GraphQL](./run_graphql.png.webp)

You can also chose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-Line Interface call.

	/>
</div>

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps that can be useful in a real-world use case:

- Pass [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [Apps](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev). Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

	<DocCard
		title="Versioning"
		description="Scripts, when deployed, can have a parent script identified by its hash."
		href="/docs/script_editor/versioning"
	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

		description="Some arguments' types can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async [webhooks](../../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx) are generated for each deployment.
