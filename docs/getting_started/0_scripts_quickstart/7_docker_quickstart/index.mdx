# Docker quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script ran from a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container.

Windmill natively supports Python, TypeScript, Go, PHP, Bash or SQL.
In some cases where your task requires a complex set of dependencies or is implemented in a non-supported language, Windmill allows running any Docker container through its [Bash](../4_bash_quickstart/index.mdx) support.

As a pre-requisite, the host docker daemon needs to be mounted into the worker container. This is done through a simple volume mount: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`.

This tutorial covers how to create a simple script through Windmill web IDE. See the dedicated page to [develop scripts locally](../../../advanced/4_local_development/index.mdx).

</div>

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_triggers/index.mdx) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

</div>

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- [Code](#code).
- [Settings](#settings): settings & metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [JSON Schema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.mdx) of its inputs (inferred from its signature).

When stored in a code repository, those 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.docker` and `<path>.script.yaml`.

Below is a simple example of a script built using Bash to run Docker containers from Windmill:

```bash
# shellcheck shell=bash
# docker
# The annotation "docker" above is important, it tells windmill that after 
# the end of the bash script, it should manage the container at id $WM_JOB_ID:
# pipe logs, monitor memory usage, kill container if job is cancelled.

msg="${1:-world}"

IMAGE="alpine:latest"
COMMAND="/bin/echo Hello $msg"

# ensure that the image is up-to-date
docker pull $IMAGE

# if using the 'docker' mode, name it with $WM_JOB_ID for windmill to monitor it
docker run --name $WM_JOB_ID -it -d $IMAGE $COMMAND
```

## Settings

![New script](../../../../static/images/script_languages.png "New script")

As part of the [settings](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx) menu, each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth.

- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by default.
- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consists of the [script's owner](../../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx), and the script's name. The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
- **Description** is where you can give instructions through the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown.
- **Language** of the script.
- **Script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx), [Error handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md) or [Preprocessor](../../../core_concepts/43_preprocessors/index.mdx). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx).

This menu also has additional settings on [Runtime](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#runtime), [Generated UI](#generated-ui) and [Triggers](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#triggers).

	/>
</div>

Now click on the code editor on the left side.

### Code

Windmill provides an online editor to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side [previews the UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can preview that UI, provide input values, and [test your script](#instant-preview--testing) there.

![Editor for Bash](../4_bash_quickstart/editor_bash.png.webp)

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Code editor"
		description="The code editor is Windmill's integrated development environment."
		href="/docs/code_editor"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Auto-generated UIs"
		description="Windmill creates auto-generated user interfaces for scripts and flows based on their parameters."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/auto_generated_uis"
	/>
</div>

As we picked `Docker` for this example, Windmill provided some Bash
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```bash
# shellcheck shell=bash
# docker
# The annotation "docker" above is important, it tells windmill that after 
# the end of the bash script, it should manage the container at id $WM_JOB_ID:
# pipe logs, monitor memory usage, kill container if job is cancelled.

msg="${1:-world}"

IMAGE="alpine:latest"
COMMAND="/bin/echo Hello $msg"

# ensure that the image is up-to-date
docker pull $IMAGE

# if using the 'docker' mode, name it with $WM_JOB_ID for windmill to monitor it
docker run --name $WM_JOB_ID -it -d $IMAGE $COMMAND
```

`msg` is just a normal Bash variable. It can be used to pass arguments to the script. This syntax is the standard Bash one to assign default values to parameters.

```
docker run --name $WM_JOB_ID -it -d $IMAGE $COMMAND
```

Windmill has a native docker support if the `# docker` annotation is used. It will assume a a docker socket is mounted like in the example above and will take over management of the container as soon as the script ends, assuming that the container was ran with the `$WM_JOB_ID` as name.
Which is why you should use docker `-d` deamon mode so that the bash script terminates early.

### Instant preview & testing

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works.

		href="/docs/core_concepts/instant_preview"
	/>
</div>

Now let's go to the last step: the "Generated UI" settings.

## Generated UI

From the Settings menu, the "Generated UI" tab lets you customize the script's arguments.

The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

![Advanced settings for Bash](../4_bash_quickstart/customize_bash.png.webp)

We're done! Save your script. Note that Scripts are [versioned](../../../core_concepts/34_versioning/index.mdx#script-versioning) in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		title="Script kind"
		description="You can attach additional functionalities to Scripts by specializing them into specific Script kinds."
		href="/docs/script_editor/script_kinds"

		title="Generated UI"
		description="main function's arguments can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

### Run!

Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the [Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx) button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs](../../../core_concepts/5_monitor_past_and_future_runs/index.mdx) menu on
the left.

![Run Hello in Bash](../4_bash_quickstart/run_bash.png.webp)

You can also choose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-line interface call.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events."
		href="/docs/getting_started/triggers"
	/>
</div>

## JSON result

The last line returned by the script will be the string result. To use a json result instead, output your result in `./result.json` and it will be automatically picked-up and considered as the JSON result for Bash and Powershell scripts.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps that can be useful in a real-world use case:

- Pass [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_triggers/index.mdx) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [Apps](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev). Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Versioning"
		description="Scripts, when deployed, can have a parent script identified by its hash."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/versioning#script-versioning"
	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Auto-generated UIs"
		description="Windmill creates auto-generated user interfaces for scripts and flows based on their parameters."

		title="Generated UI"
		description="main function's arguments can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async [webhooks](../../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx) are generated for each deployment.

		title="Webhooks"
