# Python Quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in Python. Windmill provides a Python `3.11` environment.

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows][flows] or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

	/>
</div>

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- **Code**: for python scripts, it must have at least a main function.
- **Metadata**: metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [jsonschema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md) of its inputs (inferred from its signature)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		title="JSON Schema and Parsing"
		description="JSON Schemas are used for defining the input specification for scripts and flows, and specifying resource types."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/json_schema_and_parsing"
	/>
</div>

When stored in a code repository, these 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.ts` and `<path>.script.yaml`

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Versioning"
		description="Scripts, when deployed, can have a parent script identified by its hash."
		href="/docs/script_editor/versioning"
	/>
</div>

There is no need to specify additionally the requirements/dependencies, they are inferred automatically by running an heuristics on the imports. A lockfile will be generated at deployment time so that dependencies' versions never change.

	<DocCard
		title="Dependency Management & Imports"
		description="Windmill's strength lies in its ability to run scripts without having to deal with separate dependency files."
		href="/docs/advanced/imports"
	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

		title="Customize Arguments"
		description="Some arguments' types can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_arguments"
	/>
</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async webhooks are generated for each deployment.

[This](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/%22%22/1530/do-sentiment-analysis-with-nltk-%22%22) is a simple example of a script built in Python with Windmill.

In this quick start guide, we'll create a script that greets the operator running it.

From the **Home** page, click `+Script`. This will take you to the
first step of script creation: Metadata.

![New script](./create_script_python.png.webp)

## Metadata

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consist of the
  [script's owner](../../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default.
- **Language** of the script. Windmill supports TypeScript, Python,
  Go, Bash and SQL. Let's pick Python!
- **Description**: this is where you can give instructions
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown!
- **[Concurrency limits](../../../script_editor/concurrency_limit.mdx)**: it allows you to define concurrency limits for scripts and inline scripts within flows to prevent exceeding the API Limit of the targeted API.
- **[Worker group tag](../../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.md)**, if you want to run some scripts on a GPU machine.

	<DocCard
		title="Metadata"
		description="Each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth."
		href="/docs/script_editor/metadata"
	/>
</div>

Now click on the code editor on the left side, and let's build our Hello World!

## Code

**Windmill gives you an online editor** to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side lets you **preview the UI** that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can easily preview that UI, provide input values, and test your
script there.

![Editor for python](./editor_python.png.webp)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		description="The code editor is Windmill's integrated development environment."
		href="/docs/code_editor"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Auto-generated UIs"
		description="Windmill creates auto-generated user interfaces for scripts and flows based on their parameters."

	/>
</div>

As we picked `python` for this example, Windmill provided some python
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```python
import os
import wmill

# You can import any package from PyPI


def main(no_default: str,
         name = "Nicolas Bourbaki",
         age = 42,
         obj: dict = {"even": "dicts"},
         l: list = ["or", "lists!"],
         file_: bytes = bytes(0)):
    """A main function is required for the script to be able to accept arguments.
    Types are recommended."""
    print(f"Hello World and a warm welcome especially to {name}")
    print("and its acolytes..", age, obj, l, len(file_))
    # retrieve variables, including secrets by querying the windmill platform.
    # secret fetching is audited by windmill.

    try:
      secret = wmill.get_variable("f/examples/secret")
    except:
      secret = "No secret yet at f/examples/secret !"

    print(f"The variable at `f/examples/secret`: {secret}")

    # Get last state of this script execution by the same trigger/user
    last_state = wmill.get_state()
    new_state = {"foo": 42} if last_state is None else last_state
    new_state["foo"] += 1
    wmill.set_state(new_state)

    # fetch reserved variables as environment variables
    user = os.environ.get("WM_USERNAME")
    # the return value is then parsed and can be retrieved by other scripts conveniently
    return {"splitted": name.split(), "user": user, "state": new_state}
```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating 1. the input spec of the Script, and 2.
  the frontend that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

The last import line imports the Windmill
client, which is needed for example to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx). We won't go
into that here.

Back to our Hello World. We can clean up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a Flow and need to pass it on.

```py
def main(name: str):
  print("Hello world. Oh, it's you {}? Greetings!".format(name))
  return name
```

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works.

You can change how the UI behaves by changing the main signature. For example,
if you add a default for the `name` argument, the UI won't consider this field
as required anymore.

```py
main(name: str = "you")
```

Now let's go to the last step: the "Customise" settings.

## Customize Settings

In this step, you can:

- Give a **script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.md), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.md) or [Error Handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx).
- Customize the script's **Arguments**. The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

![Advanced settings for Python](./customize_python.png.webp)

We're done! Save your script. Note that Scripts are versioned in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Script Kinds"
		description="You can attach additional functionalities to Scripts by specializing them into specific Script kinds."
		href="/docs/script_editor/script_kinds"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Customize Arguments"
		description="Some arguments' types can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_arguments"
	/>
</div>

## Run!

Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the **[Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx)** button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs][app-runs] menu on
the left.

![Run hello world in Python](./run_python.png.webp)

You can also chose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-Line Interface call.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps we need
in a real-world use case:

- Pass
  [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows][flows] or [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub][wm-hub]. Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.
