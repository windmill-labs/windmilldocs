This tutorial covers how to create a simple script through Windmill web IDE. See the dedicated page to [develop scripts locally](../../../advanced/4_local_development/index.mdx) and other methods of [handling dependencies in Python](../../../advanced/15_dependencies_in_python/index.mdx).

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_triggers/index.mdx) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

</div>

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- [Code](#code): for Python scripts, it must have at least a main function.
- [Settings](#settings): settings & metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [jsonschema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.mdx) of its inputs (inferred from its signature).

When stored in a code repository, these 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.py` and `<path>.script.yaml`

Windmill automatically manages [dependencies](../../../advanced/15_dependencies_in_python/index.mdx) for you. When you import libraries in your Python script, Windmill parses these top-level imports upon saving the script and automatically generates a list of dependencies. For automatic dependency installation, Windmill will only consider these top-level imports. It then spawns a dependency job to associate these PyPI packages with a lockfile, ensuring that the same version of the script is always executed with the same versions of its dependencies

[This](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/%22%22/1530/do-sentiment-analysis-with-nltk-%22%22) is a simple example of a script built in Python with Windmill:

```py
#import wmill
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
nltk.download("vader_lexicon")

def main(text: str = "Wow, NLTK is really powerful!"):
    return SentimentIntensityAnalyzer().polarity_scores(text)
```

In this quick start guide, we'll create a script that greets the operator running it.

From the Home page, click `+Script`. This will take you to the
first step of script creation: Metadata.

## Settings

![New script](../../../../static/images/script_languages.png "New script")

As part of the [settings](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx) menu, each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth.

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consists of the
  [script's owner](../../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default.
- **Language** of the script.
- **Description** is where you can give instructions through the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx)
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown.
- **Script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx) or [Error handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx).

This menu also has additional settings on [Runtime](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#runtime), [Generated UI](#generated-ui) and [Triggers](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#triggers).

</div>

Now click on the code editor on the left side, and let's build our Hello World!

## Code

Windmill provides an online editor to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side [previews the UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can preview that UI, provide input values, and [test your script](#instant-preview--testing) there.

![Editor for python](./editor_python.png.webp)

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard

		description="The code editor is Windmill's integrated development environment."
		href="/docs/code_editor"
	/>

		description="Windmill creates auto-generated user interfaces for scripts and flows based on their parameters."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/auto_generated_uis"
	/>
</div>

As we picked `python` for this example, Windmill provided some python
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```python
import os
import wmill

# You can import any PyPI package. 
# See here for more info: https://www.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/dependencies_in_python

# you can use typed resources by doing a type alias to dict
#postgresql = dict

def main(
    no_default: str,
    #db: postgresql,
    name="Nicolas Bourbaki",
    age=42,
    obj: dict = {"even": "dicts"},
    l: list = ["or", "lists!"],
    file_: bytes = bytes(0),
):

    print(f"Hello World and a warm welcome especially to {name}")
    print("and its acolytes..", age, obj, l, len(file_))

    # retrieve variables, resources, states using the wmill client
    try:
        secret = wmill.get_variable("f/examples/secret")
    except:
        secret = "No secret yet at f/examples/secret !"
    print(f"The variable at `f/examples/secret`: {secret}")

    # Get last state of this script execution by the same trigger/user
    last_state = wmill.get_state()
    new_state = {"foo": 42} if last_state is None else last_state
    new_state["foo"] += 1
    wmill.set_state(new_state)

    # fetch context variables
    user = os.environ.get("WM_USERNAME")

    # return value is converted to JSON
    return {"splitted": name.split(), "user": user, "state": new_state}
```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating
  1.  the [input spec](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.mdx) of the Script
  2.  the [frontend](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="JSON schema and parsing"
		description="JSON Schemas are used for defining the input specification for scripts and flows, and specifying resource types."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/json_schema_and_parsing"
	/>
</div>

The last import line imports the [Windmill client](../../../advanced/2_clients/python_client.md), which is needed for example to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		description="How to manage dependencies in Python scripts."
		href="/docs/advanced/dependencies_in_python"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Python client"
		description="The Python client library for Windmill provides a convenient way to interact with the Windmill platform's API from within your script jobs."
		href="/docs/advanced/clients/python_client"
	/>
</div>

Back to our Hello World. We can clean up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a [flow](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [app](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) and need to pass its result on.

```py
def main(name: str):
  print("Hello world. Oh, it's you {}? Greetings!".format(name))
  return name
```

## Instant preview & testing

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/auto_g_ui_landing.mp4"
/>

<br />

You can change how the UI behaves by changing the main signature. For example,
if you add a default for the `name` argument, the UI won't consider this field
as required anymore.

```py
def main(name: str = "you"):
```

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Instant preview & testing"
		description="On top of its integrated editors, Windmill allows users to see and test what they are building directly from the editor, even before deployment."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/instant_preview"
	/>
</div>

Now let's go to the last step: the "Generated UI" settings.

## Generated UI

From the Settings menu, the "Generated UI" tab lets you customize the script's arguments.

The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

		description="main function's arguments can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

## Workflows as code

One way to write distributed programs that execute distinct jobs is to use [flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) that chain scripts together.

Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program directly in your script. This is known as [workflows as code](../../../core_concepts/31_workflows_as_code/index.mdx).

![Flow as code in Python](../../../core_concepts/31_workflows_as_code/python_editor.png "Flow as code in Python")

All details at:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Workflows as code"
		description="Automate tasks and their flow with only code."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/workflows_as_code"
	/>
</div>

## Run!

We're done! Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the [Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx) button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Note that Scripts are [versioned](../../../core_concepts/34_versioning/index.mdx#script-versioning) in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs](../../../core_concepts/5_monitor_past_and_future_runs/index.mdx) menu on
the left.

![Run hello world in Python](./run_python.png.webp)

You can also choose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-line interface call.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events."
		href="/docs/getting_started/triggers"
	/>
</div>

## Select Python version

You can annotate the version of Python you would like to use for a script using the following annotations: py310, py311, py312, or py313:

```python
# py312

type Foo = str

def main():
	foo: Foo = "Foo"
	return foo
```

### Python version specifiers

You can also use more advanced version specifiers with the shortcut format to specify exact version requirements:

```python
# py: >=3.12

def main():
    return "Hello from Python 3.12+"
```

```python
# py: ==3.12.*

def main():
    return "Hello from any Python 3.12 version"
```

```python
# py: >=3.11,<3.14

def main():
    return "Hello from Python 3.11 to 3.13"
```

These version specifiers use [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) syntax and provide more precise control over Python version requirements than the simple annotations. This is especially useful when you need to ensure compatibility with specific Python features or avoid known issues in certain versions.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/annotate_py_version.mp4"
/>
<br/>

Alternatively, you can set a global version by configuring the INSTANCE_PYTHON_VERSION [environment variable](../../../core_concepts/47_environment_variables/index.mdx) to one of the mentioned versions or unset it to use "Latest Stable". If you leave `INSTANCE_PYTHON_VERSION` empty it will inherit "Latest Stable" version, which depends on Windmill.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/set_instance_py_version.mp4"
/>
<br/>

For newly deployed scripts, the annotated or instance version will be assigned to the lockfile, and all future executions will adhere to that specified version. 

For scripts that are already deployed and have no version specified in lockfile, Python 3.11 will be used by default, even if the instance version is changed to a different one.

During test runs or deployments, if there are imported scripts, Windmill will search through all of them to find an annotated version, which will be used as the final version. If no annotated version is found, the instance version will be used instead. 


For [Enterprise Edition](/pricing) (EE) customers, [S3 cache](../../../misc/13_s3_cache/index.mdx) tarballs will be organized and separated by Python version.

## Caching

Every dependency on Python is cached on disk by default. Furtherfore if you use the [Distributed cache storage](../../../misc/13_s3_cache/index.mdx), it will be available to every other worker, allowing fast startup for every worker.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps that can be useful in a real-world use case:

- Pass [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_triggers/index.mdx) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [Apps](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev). Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

	<DocCard
		title="Versioning"
		description="Scripts, when deployed, can have a parent script identified by its hash."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/versioning#script-versioning"
	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async [webhooks](../../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx) are generated for each deployment.
