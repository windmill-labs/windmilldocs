# Python Quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in Python. Windmill
provides a Python `3.11` environment.

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be run as standalone
apps, chained together to create [Flows][flows].

In Windmill, Scripts consist of three parts:

- **Metadata:** information about the Script such as its path, description, and
  author, as well as configuration.
- **Logic:** the code.
- **UI:** a UI autogenerated from the script signature, that can be customized.

For more information about how Scripts and Flows are represented within
Windmill, also see the [OpenFlow Spec.][openflow]

In this quick start guide, we'll create a Script that greets the operator
running it. From the **Home** page, click "+Script". This will take you to the
first step of script creation: metadata.

## Metadata

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consist of the
  [script's owner](../../../reference/index.md#owner), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group. This defines the permissions on
  Windmill: selecting user will keep the script _private_ to the selected
  account, while selecting group will make it available to all users of the
  given group. Let's save this script under your path, and call it
  `hello_world_python`.
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default. Let's use "Greet the user by name".
- **Language** the language of the script. Windmill supports TypeScript, Python,
  Go, Bash and SQL. <!-- You can read more about environments.  -->Let's pick
  Python!
- **Advanced** gives you access to more options, such as creating
  [specialized scripts](../../../reference/index.md) and saving the script as a
  template. We won't go into this in this quickstart.

Now hit "Next" in the top right corner, and let's build our Hello World!

## Code

Windmill gives you an online editor to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side lets you preview the UI that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can easily preview that UI, provide input values, and test your
script there.

![Editor for python](./editor_python.png)

We picked `python` for this example, so Windmill provided some python
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```python
import os
import wmill

# You can import any package from PyPI, even if the assistant complains

"""
Use Cmd/Ctrl + S to autoformat the code. Reset content in the bar to start from a clean template.
The client is used to interact with Windmill itself through its standard API.
One can explore the methods available through autocompletion of `wmill.XXX`.
"""

def main(no_default: str,
         name = "Nicolas Bourbaki",
         age = 42,
         obj: dict = {"even": "dicts"},
         l: list = ["or", "lists!"],
         file_: bytes = bytes(0)):
    """A main function is required for the script to be able to accept arguments.
    Types are recommended."""
    print(f"Hello World and a warm welcome especially to {name}")
    print("and its acolytes..", age, obj, l, len(file_))
    # retrieve variables, including secrets by querying the windmill platform.
    # secret fetching is audited by windmill.

    try:
      secret = wmill.get_variable("f/examples/secret")
    except:
      secret = "No secret yet at f/examples/secret !"

    print(f"The variable at `f/examples/secret`: {secret}")
    
    # Get last state of this script execution by the same trigger/user
    last_state = wmill.get_state()
    new_state = {"foo": 42} if last_state is None else last_state
    new_state["foo"] += 1
    wmill.set_state(new_state)

    # fetch reserved variables as environment variables
    user = os.environ.get("WM_USERNAME")
    # the return value is then parsed and can be retrieved by other scripts conveniently
    return {"splitted": name.split(), "user": user, "state": new_state}
```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating the input spec of the Script, and
  the frontend that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

Also take a look at the import statement. The `import wmill` imports the
Windmill client, that is needed for example to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.md) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md). We won't go
into that here.

Back to our Hello World. We can clear up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a Flow and need to pass it on.

```
def main(name:str):
  print("Hello world. Oh, it's you {}? Greetings!".format(name))
  return name
```

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a preview (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works. Now
let's go to the last step: the "Advanced" settings.

## Advanced settings

In this step, you can:

- Add a **Description** to the Script. This is where you can give instructions
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown!
- Customize the Script **Arguments**. The UI is generated from the Script's main
  function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example,
  we could use the `Format` add a regex here to make sure users are providing a
  name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]*$`. Let's still allow
  numbers in case you're some tech billionaire's kid.

We're done! Save your script. Note that Scripts are versioned in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

## Run!

Now let's look at what users of this script will do. Click on the **Run** button
to load this script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs][app-runs] menu on
the left.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps we need
in a real-world use case:

- Pass
  [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.md)
  to a script
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.md)
- Run scripts or flows on a
  [schedule](../../../core_concepts/5_schedules/index.md)
- Compose scripts in [Flows][flows]
- You can share your scripts with the community on [Windmill Hub][wm-hub]. Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.
