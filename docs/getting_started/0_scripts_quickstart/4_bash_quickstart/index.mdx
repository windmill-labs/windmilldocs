# Bash / PowerShell Quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in Bash and PowerShell.

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Script Editor"
		description="All the details on scripts."
		href="/docs/script_editor"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Triggering Scripts"
		description="Trigger flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events."
		href="/docs/getting_started/trigger_scripts"
	/>
</div>

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- [Code](#code).
- [Settings](#settings): settings & metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [jsonschema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md) of its inputs (inferred from its signature).

When stored in a code repository, those 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.ts` and `<path>.script.yaml`.

Below is a simple example of a script built in Bash/Powershell with Windmill:

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```bash
# shellcheck shell=bash
# arguments of the form X="$I" are parsed as parameters X of type string
url="${1:-default value}"

status_code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" $url)

if [[ $status_code == 2* ]] || [[ $status_code == 3* ]]; then
  echo "The URL is reachable!"
else
  echo "The URL is not reachable."
fi
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```ts
param($url = "default value")

$status_code = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -Method Get).StatusCode

if ($status_code -like "2*" -or $status_code -like "3*") {
    Write-Host "The URL is reachable!"
} else {
    Write-Host "The URL is not reachable."
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this quick start guide, we'll create a script that greets the operator running it.

From the Home page, click `+Script`. This will take you to the
first step of script creation: Metadata.

## Settings

![New script](./create_script_bash.png)

As part of the settings menu, each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth.

- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consist of the
  [script's owner](../../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx), and the script's name.
  The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It
  will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by
  default.
- **Language** of the script.
- **Description** is where you can give instructions through the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx)
  to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown.
- **Script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx) or [Error Handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx).

This menu also has additional settings, such as:

- **[Concurrency limits](../../../script_editor/concurrency_limit.mdx)** enable defining concurrency limits for scripts and inline scripts within flows to prevent exceeding the API Limit of the targeted API.
- **[Worker group tag](../../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx)** to assign scripts to specific worker groups (such as nodes with GPU accelaration).
- **[Cache](../../../core_concepts/24_caching/index.md)** to cache the results for each possible inputs for a given time.
- **[Dedicated Workers](../../../core_concepts/25_dedicated_workers/index.mdx)** to run the script on, to run the script at native speed. Only available on enterprise edition and for the Bun language.

	<DocCard
		title="Settings"
		description="Each script has metadata & settings associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth."
		href="/docs/script_editor/settings"
	/>
</div>

Now click on the code editor on the left side.

## Code

Windmill provides an online editor to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side [previews the UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can preview that UI, provide input values, and [test your script](#instant-preview--testing) there.

![Editor for Bash](./editor_bash.png)

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Code Editor"
		description="The code editor is Windmill's integrated development environment."
		href="/docs/code_editor"
	/>
	<DocCard
		title="Auto-generated UIs"
		description="Windmill creates auto-generated user interfaces for scripts and flows based on their parameters."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/auto_generated_uis"
	/>
</div>

### Bash

As we picked `Bash` for this example, Windmill provided some Bash
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```bash
# shellcheck shell=bash
# arguments of the form X="$I" are parsed as parameters X of type string
msg="$1"
dflt="${2:-default value}"

# the last line of the stdout is the return value
echo "Hello $msg"
```

In Bash, the arguments are inferred from the arguments requiring a $1, $2, $3. Default arguments can be specified using the syntax above: `dflt="${2:-default value}"`.

The command `echo` allows you to return the result, which might be useful if the script is used in a [flow](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [app](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) to pass its result on.

### PowerShell

As we picked `PowerShell` for this example, Windmill provided some Bash
boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```bash
param($Msg, $Dflt = "default value", [int]$Nb = 3)

# the last line of the stdout is the return value
Write-Output "Hello $Msg"
```

In PowerShell, the arguments are inferred from the arguments requiring a "$" preceding its name.
Default arguments can be specified using the syntax above: `$argument_name = "Its default value"`.

The command `Write-Output` allows you to return the result, which might be useful if the script is used in a [flow](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [app](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) to pass its result on.

## Instant Preview & Testing

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works.

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    controls
    src="/videos/auto_g_ui_landing.mp4"
/>

<br/>

You can change how the UI behaves by changing the main signature. For example,
if you add a default for the `name` argument, the UI won't consider this field
as required anymore.

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="bash" label="Bash" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```bash
argument_name="${1:-Its default value}"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="powershell" label="PowerShell" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```bash
$argument_name = "Its default value"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Instant Preview & Testing"
		description="On top of its integrated editors, Windmill allows users to see and test what they are building directly from the editor, even before deployment."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/instant_preview"
	/>
</div>

Now let's go to the last step: the "Generated UI" settings.

## Customize UI

From the Settings menu, the "Generated UI" tab lets you customize the script's arguments.

The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

		description="You can attach additional functionalities to Scripts by specializing them into specific Script kinds."
		href="/docs/script_editor/script_kinds"
	/>

		title="Customize UI"
		description="Some arguments' types can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

## Run!

We're done! Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the [Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx) button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Note that Scripts are versioned in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely [identified by a hash](../../../script_editor/versioning.mdx)

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs](../../../core_concepts/5_monitor_past_and_future_runs/index.mdx) menu on
the left.

![Run Hello in Bash](./run_bash.png)

You can also chose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-Line Interface call.

	/>
</div>

## Run Docker Containers

In some cases where your task requires a complex set of dependencies or is implemented in a non-supported language, you can still include it as a flow step or individual script.

Windmill supports running any docker container through its Bash support. As a pre-requisite, the host docker daemon needs to be mounted into the worker container. This is done through a simple volume mount: `/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		href="/docs/advanced/docker"
	/>
</div>

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps that can be useful in a real-world use case:

- Pass [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_trigger_scripts/index.mdx) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [Apps](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev). Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Versioning"
		description="Scripts, when deployed, can have a parent script identified by its hash."
		href="/docs/script_editor/versioning"
	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		description="Some arguments' types can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async [webhooks](../../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.md) are generated for each deployment.
