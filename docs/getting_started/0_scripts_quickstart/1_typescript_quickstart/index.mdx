# TypeScript quickstart

In this quick start guide, we will write our first script in TypeScript. Windmill uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Nodejs](#nodejs) and [Deno](https://deno.land/) as the available TypeScript runtimes.

This tutorial covers how to create a simple "Hello World" script in TypeScript through Windmill web IDE, with the standard mode of handling dependencies in TypeScript (Lockfile per script inferred from imports). See the dedicated pages to [develop scripts locally](../../../advanced/4_local_development/index.mdx) and other methods of [handling dependencies in TypeScript](../../../advanced/14_dependencies_in_typescript/index.mdx).

Scripts are the basic building blocks in Windmill. They can be [run and scheduled](../../8_triggers/index.mdx) as standalone, chained together to create [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or displayed with a personalized User Interface as [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Script editor"
		description="All the details on scripts."
		href="/docs/script_editor"

</div>

Scripts consist of 2 parts:

- [Code](#code): for TypeScript scripts, it must have at least a main function.
- [Settings](#settings): settings & metadata about the Script such as its path, summary, description, [JSON Schema](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.mdx) of its inputs (inferred from its signature).

When stored in a code repository, those 2 parts are stored separately at `<path>.ts` and `<path>.script.yaml`.

[This](https://hub.windmill.dev/scripts/slack/1284/send-message-to-channel-slack) is a simple example of a script built in TypeScript with Windmill:

```ts
import { WebClient } from '@slack/web-api';

type Slack = {
	token: string;
};

export async function main(slack: Slack, channel: string, message: string): Promise<void> {
	// Initialize the Slack WebClient with the token from the Slack resource
	const web = new WebClient(slack.token);

	// Use the chat.postMessage method from the Slack WebClient to send a message
	await web.chat.postMessage({
		channel: channel,
		text: message
	});
}
```

In this quick start guide, we'll create a script that greets the operator running it.

From the Home page, click `+Script`. This will take you to the first step of script creation: [Metadata](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#metadata).

## Settings

![New script](../../../../static/images/script_languages.png "New script")

As part of the [settings](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx) menu, each script has metadata associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth.

- **Summary** (optional) is a short, human-readable summary of the Script. It will be displayed as a title across Windmill. If omitted, the UI will use the `path` by default.
- **Path** is the Script's unique identifier that consists of the [script's owner](../../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx), and the script's name. The owner can be either a user, or a group ([folder](../../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#folders)).
- **Description** is where you can give instructions through the [auto-generated UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) to users on how to run your Script. It supports markdown.
- **Language** of the script.
- **Script kind**: Action (by default), [Trigger](../../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx), [Approval](../../../flows/11_flow_approval.mdx), [Error handler](../../../flows/7_flow_error_handler.md) or [Preprocessor](../../../core_concepts/43_preprocessors/index.mdx). This acts as a tag to filter appropriate scripts from the [flow editor](../../6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx).

This menu also has additional settings on [Runtime](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#runtime), [Generated UI](#generated-ui) and [Triggers](../../../script_editor/settings.mdx#triggers).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Settings"
		description="Each script has metadata & settings associated with it, enabling it to be defined and configured in depth."
		href="/docs/script_editor/settings"
	/>
</div>

Now click on the code editor on the left side.

## Code

Windmill provides an online editor to work on your Scripts. The left-side is
the editor itself. The right-side [previews the UI](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that Windmill will
generate from the Script's signature - this will be visible to the users of the
Script. You can preview that UI, provide input values, and [test your script](#instant-preview--testing) there.

![Demo TS](./demo_ts.png 'Demo TS')

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

</div>

There are two options for runtimes in TypeScript:

- Bun (with a [Nodejs](#nodejs) mode if needed)
- [Deno](#deno)

As we picked `TypeScript (Bun)` for this example, Windmill provided some TypeScript boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```typescript
// there are multiple modes to add as header: //nobundling //native //npm //nodejs
// https://www.windmill.dev/docs/getting_started/scripts_quickstart/typescript#modes

// import { toWords } from "number-to-words@1"
import * as wmill from "windmill-client"

// fill the type, or use the +Resource type to get a type-safe reference to a resource
// type Postgresql = object


export async function main(
  a: number,
  b: "my" | "enum",
  //c: Postgresql,
  //d: wmill.S3Object, // https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/persistent_storage/large_data_files 
  //d: DynSelect_foo, // https://www.windmill.dev/docs/core_concepts/json_schema_and_parsing#dynamic-select
  e = "inferred type string from default arg",
  f = { nested: "object" },
  g: {
    label: "Variant 1",
    foo: string
  } | {
    label: "Variant 2",
    bar: number
  }
) {
  // let x = await wmill.getVariable('u/user/foo')
  return { foo: a };
}
```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating
  1.  the [input spec](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.mdx) of the Script
  2.  the [frontend](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="JSON schema and parsing"
		description="JSON Schemas are used for defining the input specification for scripts and flows, and specifying resource types."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/json_schema_and_parsing"
	/>
</div>

Also take a look at the import statement lines that are commented out.
In TypeScript, [dependencies](../../../advanced/14_dependencies_in_typescript/index.mdx) and their versions are contained in the script and hence there is no need for any additional steps.
The TypeScript runtime is Bun, which is 100% compatible with Node.js without any code modifications.
You can use npm imports directly in Windmill. The last import line imports the Windmill
client, that is needed for example, to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx). We won't go
into that here.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		description="The TypeScript client for Windmill allows you to interact with the Windmill platform using TypeScript in Bun / Deno runtime."
		href="/docs/advanced/clients/ts_client"
	/>
</div>

Back to our "Hello World". We can clear up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a [flow](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [app](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) and need to pass its result on.

```typescript
export async function main(name: string) {
	console.log("Hello world! Oh, it's you %s? Greetings!", name);
	return { name };
}
```

## Modes

### Pre-bundling and nobundling

Windmill [pre-bundles](/changelog/pre-bundle-bun-scripts) your script at deployment time using [Bun bundler](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler). This improve memory usage and speed up the execution time of your script. If you would like to disable this feature, you can add the following comment at the top of your script:

```ts
//nobundling
```

### Native

Windmill provides a runtime that is more lightweight but supports less features and allow to run scripts in a more lightweight manner with direct bindings to v8. To enable, you can add the following comment at the top of your script:

```ts
//native
```

To learn more, see [Rest](../6_rest_grapqhql_quickstart/index.mdx) scripts, that are under the hood Bun TypeScripts with a `//native` header.

### NodeJS

Windmill provides a true NodeJS compatibility mode. This means that you can run your existing NodeJS code without any modifications.

The only thing you need to do is to select `TypeScript (Bun)` as the runtime and as the first line, use:

```ts
//nodejs
```

![Nodejs Compatibility](./nodejs_compatibility.png 'Nodejs Compatibility')

This method is an escape hatch for using another runtime (NodeJS), but it is slower than Deno and Bun since it resorts to Bun under the hood.

This feature is exclusive to [Cloud plans and Self-Hosted Enterprise edition](/pricing).

### Npm

Similarly, you can use `npm install` instead of `bun install` to install dependencies. This is useful as an escape hatch for cases not supported by bun:

```ts
//npm
```

This is also exclusive to [Cloud plans and Self-Hosted Enterprise edition](/pricing).

### Deno

As we picked `TypeScript (Deno)` for this example, Windmill provided some TypeScript boilerplate. Let's take a look:

```typescript
// Ctrl/CMD+. to cache dependencies on imports hover.

// Deno uses "npm:" prefix to import from npm (https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.3/node/npm_specifiers)
// import * as wmill from "npm:windmill-client@1.525.0"

// fill the type, or use the +Resource type to get a type-safe reference to a resource
// type Postgresql = object

export async function main(
  a: number,
  b: "my" | "enum",
  //c: Postgresql,
  d = "inferred type string from default arg",
  e = { nested: "object" },
  //e: wmill.Base64
) {
  // let x = await wmill.getVariable('u/user/foo')
  return { foo: a };
}
```

In Windmill, scripts need to have a `main` function that will be the script's
entrypoint. There are a few important things to note about the `main`.

- The main arguments are used for generating
  1.  the [input spec](../../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.mdx) of the Script
  2.  the [frontend](../../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) that you see when running the Script as a standalone app.
- Type annotations are used to generate the UI form, and help pre-validate
  inputs. While not mandatory, they are highly recommended. You can customize
  the UI in later steps (but not change the input type!).

		description="JSON Schemas are used for defining the input specification for scripts and flows, and specifying resource types."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/json_schema_and_parsing"
	/>
</div>

Also take a look at the import statement lines that are commented out.
In TypeScript, [dependencies](../../../advanced/14_dependencies_in_typescript/index.mdx) and their versions are contained in the script and hence there is no need for any additional steps.
The resolution is done by [Deno](https://deno.com/runtime).
You can use npm imports directly in Windmill. The last import line imports the Windmill
client, that is needed for example, to access
[variables](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) or
[resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx). We won't go
into that here.

</div>

Back to our "Hello World". We can clear up unused import statements, change the
main to take in the user's name. Let's also return the `name`, maybe we can use
this later if we use this Script within a [flow](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [app](../../../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) and need to pass its result on.

```typescript
export async function main(name: string) {
	console.log("Hello world! Oh, it's you %s? Greetings!", name);
	return { name };
}
```

## Instant preview & testing

Look at the UI preview on the right: it was updated to match the input
signature. Run a test (`Ctrl` + `Enter`) to verify everything works.

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	controls
	src="/videos/auto_g_ui_landing.mp4"
/>

<br />

You can change how the UI behaves by changing the main signature. For example, if you add a default for the `name` argument, the UI won't consider this field as required anymore.

```typescript
main(name: string = "you")
```

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Instant preview & testing"
		description="On top of its integrated editors, Windmill allows users to see and test what they are building directly from the editor, even before deployment."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/instant_preview"
	/>
</div>

Now let's go to the last step: the "Generated UI" settings.

## Generated UI

From the Settings menu, the "Generated UI" tab lets you customize the script's arguments.

The UI is generated from the Script's main function signature, but you can add additional constraints here. For example, we could use the `Customize property`: add a regex by clicking on `Pattern` to make sure users are providing a name with only alphanumeric characters: `^[A-Za-z0-9]+$`. Let's still allow numbers in case you are some tech billionaire's kid.

		description="main function's arguments can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

## Workflows as code

One way to write distributed programs that execute distinct jobs is to use [flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) that chain scripts together.

Another approach is to write a program that defines the jobs and their dependencies, and then execute that program directly in your script. This is known as [workflows as code](../../../core_concepts/31_workflows_as_code/index.mdx).

![Flow as code in TypeScript](./flow_as_code_ts.png 'Flow as code in TypeScript')

All details at:

	<DocCard
		title="Workflows as code"
		description="Automate tasks and their flow with only code."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/workflows_as_code"
	/>
</div>

## Run!

We're done! Now let's look at what users of the script will do. Click on the [Deploy](../../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx) button
to load the script. You'll see the user input form we defined earlier.

Note that Scripts are [versioned](../../../core_concepts/34_versioning/index.mdx#script-versioning) in Windmill, and
each script version is uniquely identified by a hash.

Fill in the input field, then hit "Run". You should see a run view, as well as
your logs. All script runs are also available in the [Runs](../../../core_concepts/5_monitor_past_and_future_runs/index.mdx) menu on
the left.

![Run hello world in TypeScript](./run_ts.png.webp)

You can also choose to [run the script from the CLI](../../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx) with the pre-made Command-line interface call.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Triggers"
		description="Trigger scripts and flows on-demand, by schedule or on external events."
		href="/docs/getting_started/triggers"
	/>
</div>

## Caching

Every bundle on Bun is cached on disk by default. Furtherfore if you use the [Distributed cache storage](../../../misc/13_s3_cache/index.mdx), it will be available to every other worker, allowing fast startup for every worker.

## What's next?

This script is a minimal working example, but there's a few more steps that can be useful in a real-world use case:

- Pass [variables and secrets](../../../core_concepts/2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx)
  to a script.
- Connect to [resources](../../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).
- [Trigger that script](../../8_triggers/index.mdx) in many ways.
- Compose scripts in [Flows](../../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) or [Apps](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).
- You can [share your scripts](../../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md) with the community on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev). Once
  submitted, they will be verified by moderators before becoming available to
  everyone right within Windmill.

Scripts are immutable and there is an hash for each deployment of a given script. Scripts are never overwritten and referring to a script by path is referring to the latest deployed hash at that path.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Versioning"
		description="Scripts, when deployed, can have a parent script identified by its hash."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/versioning#script-versioning"
	/>
</div>

For each script, a UI is autogenerated from the jsonchema inferred from the script signature, and can be customized further as standalone or embedded into rich UIs using the [App builder](../../7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">

		title="Generated UI"
		description="main function's arguments can be given advanced settings that will affect the inputs' auto-generated UI and JSON Schema."
		href="/docs/script_editor/customize_ui"
	/>
</div>

In addition to the UI, sync and async [webhooks](../../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx) are generated for each deployment.
