# VS Code Extension

The Windmill VS Code extension allows you to build scripts and flows in the comfort of your VS Code Editor, while leveraging Windmill UIs for test & flows edition.

![VS Code Extension](../../../blog/2023-11-20-vscode/vscode_extension.png 'VS Code Extension')

The extension can be used in particular from a [repository synchronized to a Windmill instance](../../advanced/3_cli/sync.mdx) to [develop scripts & flows locally](../../advanced/4_local_development/index.mdx) while keeping them synced to your workspace.

Windmill has its own IDE for creating [scripts](../../script_editor/index.mdx) and [flows](../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) from the Windmill application (cloud or [self-hosted](../../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx)).

The Windmill UI allows you to edit directly the deployed scripts & flows, which is great for maintenance and quick prototyping.

However in many production settings it is more common to version everything from git and to that end we have a CLI to sync a workspace to a local directory and the inverse operation (deploy local directory to a workspace). With this extension, you can efficiently edit scripts & flows directly from there.

To run scripts locally, see [Run Locally](../../advanced/4_local_development/run_locally.mdx).

## Installation

1. First of all, have your workspace synced locally with [Windmill CLI](../../advanced/3_cli/index.mdx).

![Local workspace](../../../blog/2023-11-20-vscode/local_workspace.png.webp)

> [Example repo](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-sync-example) opened in VS Code. We see 2 flows and 1 script, the flows are their own folders, each step in a flow is a seperate file in their respective language. Scripts have their metadata in a seperate file.

<br />

With [wmill sync pull](../../advanced/3_cli/sync.mdx#pulling-1) and [wmill sync push](../../advanced/3_cli/sync.mdx#pushing-1) you can synchronize your remote workspace to a local directory which you would version with GitHub / GitLab.

In the settings menu, set the remote url, workspace name and [token](../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx#user-token).

1. Install the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill).

2. Enter your Windmill remote URL and [token](../../core_concepts/4_webhooks/index.mdx#user-token), so the extension can execute scripts and flows on your workspace.

3. From any script file, use `> Windmill: Run preview in the current editor` or Ctrl+Enter and Shift+Enter to generate the UI preview (provided that the script meets the [few rules](../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md#json-schema-in-windmill) required by Windmill).

The preview & run will work for any script meeting the specific language requirements (main function, imports) and being named with the dedicated file extension (.py, .go etc.). For scripts in Bun, name the file \[name\].bun.ts, ".ts" being by default Deno.

The extension will split your screen and display a panel. That panel will update automatically based on the edited document on the left.

- When editing a script (or a flow step), you see the script [preview UI](../../core_concepts/6_auto_generated_uis/index.mdx) with the [auto-inference of the parameters](../../core_concepts/13_json_schema_and_parsing/index.md).
- When editing a flow YAML, you it contains the flow builder and the flow [test UI](../../flows/18_test_flows.mdx).

In particular:

## Test scripts, flows and flows steps from VS Code

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	autoPlay
	loop
	src="/videos/vs_code_tour.mp4"
/>

## Editing the YAML definition of a flow instantly updates the rendered graph

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	autoPlay
	loop
	src="/videos/ui_to_yaml.mp4"
/>

## Editing the flow from the UI immediately modifies the YAML definition

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	autoPlay
	loop
	src="/videos/yaml_to_ui.mp4"
/>

## Commands
