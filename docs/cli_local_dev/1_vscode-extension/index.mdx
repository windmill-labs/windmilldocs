# VS Code Extension

The Windmill VS Code extension allows you to run your scripts & flows and preview the output within VS Code. This feature lets you preview your work without leaving the code editor.

![demo](./main.png.webp)

The extension can be used in particular from a [repository syncronized to a Windmill instance](../../advanced/3_cli/sync.mdx) to [develop scripts & flows locally](../../advanced/4_local_development/index.mdx) while keeping them synced to your workspace.

The VS Code extension is an efficient way to develop scripts and flows locally - not in Windmill's own [script](../../script_editor/index.mdx) and [flow](../../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) editors - but the scripts and flows ran from there
are actually executed in remote from your Windmill instance. To run scripts locally, see [Run Locally](../../advanced/4_local_development/run_locally.mdx).

You can also follow this link to the extension page on the VS Code marketplace: [Install it](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill).

## Quick Start

Open the command menu (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P) and run:

`> Windmill: Configure remote, workspace and token`

In the settings menu, set the remote url, workspace name and token.

Once done, on any page you'd like to edit, run:

`> Windmill: Run preview in the current editor`

The keybidings for that command are: Ctrl+Enter and Shfit+Enter.

The preview & run will work for any script meeting the specific language requirements (main function, imports) and being named with the dedicated file extension (.py, .go etc.). For scripts in Bun, name the file \[name\].bun.ts, ".ts" being by default Deno.

## Features

- The extension will automatically detect the current scripts & flows and load the schema.
- Run your scripts & flows and preview the output within VS Code.
- Review logs and results
- Check run history

## Commands

Access these commands through the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P):
