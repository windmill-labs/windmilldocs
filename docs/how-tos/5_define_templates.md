# Define and reuse templates

In order to allow other users to rapidly write scripts, you can define
templates. This is particularly useful with resources for example: you can
define a template script that can be rapidly used with that resource.

Templates are just scripts! In addition, they get listed as templates in the
Scripts page:

![Add from template](../assets/how_to/add_from_template.png)

When creating a script as a template, the script's code will be pre-filled with
the template code.
