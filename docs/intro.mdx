# Introduction

Windmill is a fast, **<a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill" >open-source</a>** alternative to platforms like Retool, Airplane, Superblocks, n8n, Airflow, and Temporal, designed to **build comprehensive internal tools** (endpoints, workflows, UIs). It supports coding in Typescript, Python, Go, Bash, SQL, or any Docker image, alongside intuitive low-code builders, featuring:

- An [execution runtime](./getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/index.mdx) for scalable, low-latency function execution across a worker fleet.
- An [orchestrator](./getting_started/6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx) for assembling these functions into efficient, low-latency flows, using either a low-code builder or YAML.
- An [app builder](./getting_started/7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx) for creating data-centric dashboards, utilizing low-code or JS frameworks like React.

Windmill supports both UI-based operation via its webIDE and low-code builders, as well as CLI deployments from a git repository, aligning with your preferred development style.

## Quickstarts

Windmill integrates three core layers—Scripts, Flows, and Apps—that complement each other. Scripts, the fundamental units, underlie the creation of workflows and UIs.
