# Introduction

Windmill is an **<a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill" >open-source</a>**, blazing fast and scalable alternative to Retool, Airplane, Superblocks, n8n, Airflow, Temporal to **build all your internal tools (endpoints, workflows, UIs) through the combination of code** (in Typescript, Python, Go, Bash, SQL or any docker image) and low code builders. It embeds all-in-one:

- an [execution runtime](./getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/index.mdx) to execute functions at scale with low-latency and no overhead on a fleet of workers
- an [orchestrator](./getting_started/6_flows_quickstart/index.mdx) to compose functions into powerful flows at low-latency built with a low-code builder (or yaml if that's your thing)
- an [app builder](./getting_started/7_apps_quickstart/index.mdx) to build application and data-intensive dashboards built with low-code or JS frameworks such as React.

Windmill supports both UI-based operation via its webIDE and low-code builders, as well as CLI deployments from a git repository, aligning with your preferred development style.

## Quickstarts

Windmill is a feature-rich platform that allows you to build endpoints, cron jobs, workflows & UIs. Each of these features can be used standalone.

However the 3 core layers of Windmill, namely Scripts, Flows and Apps are complementary. Scripts are the smallest "unit" of abstraction: workflows and UIs all rely on them.
