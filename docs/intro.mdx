# Introduction

Windmill is an **<a href="https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill" >open-source</a>**, blazing fast and scalable alternative to Retool, Airplane, Superblocks, n8n, Airflow, Temporal to **build all your internal tools (endpoints, workflows, UIs) through the combination of code** (in Typescript, Python, Go & Bash, or any docker image) and low code builders. It embeds all-in-one:

- an **execution runtime** to execute functions at scale with low-latency and no overhead on a fleet of workers
- an **orchestrator** to compose functions into powerful flows at low-latency built with a low-code builder (or yaml if that's your thing)
- an **app builder** to build application and data-intensive dashboards built with low-code or JS frameworks such a React.

Windmill can be used solely from its UI through its [webIDE](./getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx), and low-code builders but it is also possible to keep using your editor and deploy from a [git repo](./advanced/9_deploy_gh_gl/index.md) using a [CLI](./cli_local_dev/index.md).

Start building now using our **<a href="https://app.windmill.dev/" rel="nofollow" >Cloud App</a>** (no credit card required) or **<a href="/docs/advanced/self_host" >Self-Host</a>** yourself.

## Quick Overview of Windmill

Windmill is a feature-rich platform that allows you to build endpoints, cron jobs, workflows & UIs. Each of these features can be used standalone.

However the 3 core layers of Windmill, namely Scripts, Flows and Apps are complementary. Scripts are the smallest "unit" of abstraction: workflows and UIs all rely on them.
