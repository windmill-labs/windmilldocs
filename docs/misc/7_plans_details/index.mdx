## White Labeling Windmill

Windmill offers white labeling capabilities, allowing you to customize the Windmill platform to align with your brand. We do provide a library to embed the entire Windmill app or specific components - such as the flow builder or the app builder - into your own application or website. This enables you to provide Windmill's services to your clients while maintaining your brand's identity.

For more information about white labeling and customization options, see:

- You can reach out to us via contact@windmill.dev, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB), or schedule a [meeting](https://www.windmill.dev/book-demo) for an introduction session.

At the end of the subscription period (or trial), you will receive another license key valid for a year.
- To have your instance switch from Community Edition to Enterprise Edition, you'll need to change the Windmill image:
  - [Docker](../../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx#docker): in [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml) and [.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env).
  - [Helm](../../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx#enterprise-deployment-with-helm): see the [Helm Chart repository README](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts).
- To adjust the number of seats, you can update your usage on the subscription page at [Windmill billing portal](https://windmill.dev/billing).
- Usage is self-declared. We kindly request that you export your usage stats by sending us an email containing the data exported by Windmill through the provided export button at the end of the subscription period.
- As an Enterprise user, you will have access to detailed usage information and invoices through the [Windmill billing portal](https://windmill.dev/billing).
- (*By end of 2023*: Please note that we are migrating to an automatic reporting system by end of year for usage reporting that will automatically update Stripe links.)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **What is an operator?** An [operator](../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx) is a user who can only execute scripts, flows, and apps but cannot create or edit them.
- **What is an execution?** An execution corresponds to a single job with a duration of less than 1s. Additional computation is accounted for based on the duration of each job.
- **What is your Technical Support SLA?** We provide [support](../12_support_and_sla/index.mdx) with different response times based on issue priorities. Our support team is available 24/7, and the SLA is consistent for both Cloud and Self-hosted deployments.
- **What is your Security level on APIs?** Windmill is SOC 2 Type II compliant, and we prioritize addressing vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Could the application keep running if Windmill as a company is shut down?** Yes, Windmill will continue to operate as long as the license key remains valid, even in the absence of an internet connection. If Windmill shuts down, license keys will be extended indefinitely.
