# Plans & How to Upgrade

Windmill provides a range of pricing plans for both Cloud and Self-hosted deployments, catering to diverse needs. These plans are designed to accommodate individual users, small teams, and enterprise-level organizations, offering additional features, resources, enhanced capabilities, and premium support beyond the free tier.

## Cloud Plans

All Windmill Cloud plans (Community, Team, Enterprise) have most of the Enterprise features.
The only distinctions will be around the number of users, number of computations, audit logs retention period, support and some networks and security features.

All details on the [Pricing page](/pricing).

</div>

## Self-Hosted Plans

Windmill is free and open source. If self-hosted, the number of executions will be unlimited. The Enterprise plan allows access to some useful features for the use of Windmill in a corporate use case, with technical and security specifics ([Audit logs](../../core_concepts/14_audit_logs/index.mdx), [S3 integration](/blog/launch-week-1/data-pipeline-orchestrator), [Git Sync](../../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx), [Worker Groups Management UI](../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx)).

The Pro plan contains the main Enterprise features. It is exclusively available to non-profits and companies with fewer than 10 employees and $250k in revenue.

We share our pricing grid and the features of each plan on the [Pricing page](/pricing) in the most transparent way possible.

## White Labeling Windmill

Windmill offers white labeling capabilities, allowing you to customize the Windmill platform to align with your brand. We do provide a library to embed the entire Windmill app or specific components - such as the flow builder or the app builder - into your own application or website. This enables you to provide Windmill's services to your clients while maintaining your brand's identity.

For more information about white labeling and customization options, see:

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **What is an operator?**

  An [operator](../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx) is a user that can only execute script, flows and apps, but not create and edit them. This is enforced by both a simplified frontend and a restricted API. Operators are 1/2 price of developers (or 1/2 seats).

- **What is an execution?**

  The single credit-unit is called a "execution". An execution corresponds to a single [job](../../core_concepts/20_jobs/index.mdx) whose duration is less than 1s. For any additional seconds of computation, an additional computation is accounted for.

  The number of executions of a flow corresponds to the sum of the executions of each step as seconds, considered as one script execution of that same time (time in sleep or doing state transition are not accounted). For apps, a backend script execution is considered as a script execution. As apps frontend scripts execute on browsers, they are not taken into account.

  Jobs are executed on one powerful virtual CPU with 2Gb of memory. Most jobs will take less than 200ms to execute.

- **How is the use of the number of vCPUs and seats reported to Windmill?**

  Subscription is self-declared and crossed with the lightweight telemetry that we do. For an air-gapped environment, We kindly request that you export your usage stats by sending us an email containing the data exported by Windmill through the provided export button at the end of the subscription period.

  The vCPUs reported is the sum of the vCPUs used by all your workers. 5 workers with 0.2vCPUs each will count as 1vCPU. 2 workers with 4vCPU each will count as 8vCPUs. So you can simply set limits in the [docker-compose](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) or ecs/kubernetes limits and you will never be overcharged

- **What is your Technical Support SLA?**

  We provide [support](../12_support_and_sla/index.mdx) with different response times based on issue priorities. Our support team is available 24/7, and the SLA is consistent for both Cloud and Self-hosted deployments.

- **What is your Security level on APIs?**

  Windmill is SOC 2 Type II compliant, and we prioritize addressing vulnerabilities promptly.

- **Could the application keep running if Windmill as a company is shut down?**

  Yes, Windmill will continue to operate as long as the license key remains valid, even in the absence of an internet connection. If Windmill shuts down, license keys will be extended indefinitely.
