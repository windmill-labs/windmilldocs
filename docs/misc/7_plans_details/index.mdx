## Cloud plans

All Windmill cloud plans (Community, Team, Enterprise) have most of the Enterprise features.
The only distinctions will be around the number of users, number of computations, audit logs retention period, support and some networks and security features.

All details on the [Pricing page](/pricing).

## Self-hosted plans

Windmill is free and open source. If self-hosted, the number of executions will be unlimited. The Enterprise plan allows access to some useful features for the use of Windmill in a corporate use case, with technical and security specifics ([Audit logs](../../core_concepts/14_audit_logs/index.mdx), [Workspace & instance object storage](../../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx), [Git sync](../../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx), [Worker groups management UI](../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx)).

The Pro plan contains the main Enterprise features. It is [exclusively available](/pricing#pro-plan) to individuals and companies with fewer than 10 employees and $250k in revenue.

Non-profits & Universities benefit from the regular Enterprise plan at a 60% discount.

We share our pricing grid and the features of each plan on the [Pricing page](/pricing) in the most transparent way possible.

## White labeling Windmill

Windmill offers white labeling capabilities, allowing you to embed and customize the Windmill platform to align with your brand. We do provide a library to embed the entire Windmill app or specific components - such as the flow builder or the app builder - into your own application or website. This enables you to provide Windmill's services to your clients while maintaining your brand's identity.

For more information about white labeling and customization options, see:

## How to upgrade to each plan

### Upgrading to Team Edition

Team plans work at the workspace-level.

- To upgrade to the Team edition, navigate to your workspace on the <a href="https://app.windmill.dev/" rel="nofollow">Windmill cloud</a> platform.
- Click on your username and select "Upgrade" from the options.
- You will be redirected to the Workspace tab, where you can click on "Upgrade to the Team plan".
- Follow the instructions to complete the upgrade process, which includes accessing the Stripe payment page.
- The billing will be automatically adjusted based on the number of users/operators and computations.

### Upgrading to Enterprise Edition

#### Cloud

- To upgrade your instance to the Enterprise Edition, please reach out to us via contact@windmill.dev, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB), or schedule a [meeting](https://www.windmill.dev/book-demo).
- Once you contact us, we will provide you with a secure payment link.
- Upon payment, you will get access to a dedicated Windmill instance on the cloud.

- As an Enterprise user, you will have access to detailed usage information and invoices through the [Windmill customer portal](#windmill-customer-portal) where you can update plan usage and adjust the number of seats.

- To have a fully Enterprise Edition Windmill, we recommend also setting up:
	- [SSO/SAML](../2_setup_oauth/index.mdx) for user management and authentification.
	- [S3 / Azure Blob storage integration](../../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#workspace-object-storage) within a Windmill workspace to manage large data files.
	- [Instance object storage](../../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#instance-object-storage) to have a dedicated S3 storage for large-scale log management and distributed dependency caching.
	- [Git sync](../../advanced/11_git_sync/index.mdx) to have workspace synchronize with a Git repository for version control.

#### Self-host

<br />

The subscription to the Enterprise Self-Host offer is done through a [secure payment link](https://billing.windmill.dev/b/4gw4hu51YbfZ0N200j), with a 1-month free trial. You can reach out to us via contact@windmill.dev, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB), or schedule a [meeting](https://www.windmill.dev/book-demo) for an introduction session.

To have your instance switch from Free Edition to Enterprise Edition, make sure to use the [ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill-ee](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/pkgs/container/windmill-ee) image in all your servers/workers containers, in particular you'll need to change the Windmill image:
- [Docker](../../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx#docker): in [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml) and [.env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env).
- [Helm](../../advanced/1_self_host/index.mdx#enterprise-deployment-with-helm): see the [Helm chart repository README](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts).

Upon subscribing, you will receive a [license key](#using-the-license-key-self-host) to pass in the [Instance settings](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#license-key). The key will self-update every day at 2 a.m CET as long as the subscription is valid (being paid). A key is valid for 35 days.

Your license key can be used accross multiple instances. Just make sure to turn dev / staging instances as 'Non-prod' in the [Instance settings](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#non-prod-instance) so that their computation usage is not taken into account. Seats however are counted in for non-prod instances as the unique set of users across all instances based on email address, therefore each user is counted only once.

To adjust the number of seats, you can update your usage on the subscription page at [Windmill customer portal](#windmill-customer-portal).

Windmill employs lightweight [telemetry](#usage-checks) to automatically track and report the usage of memory and seats for your subscription. Even on self-hosted plans, telemetry associated to your license key is reported to Windmill.

How the data is calculated:
- Seats: number of users (1 developer, or 2 operators) who are active (from logging in to running or deploying a script) on the platform in the last 30 days, according to the [audit logs](../../core_concepts/14_audit_logs/index.mdx). User count is across all instances (dev, prod) but Windmill only counts once the same user.
- Memory: we aggregate the limits of all production containers. Workers come in different sizes: small (1GB), standard (2GB), and large (> 2GB). For each [Compute Unit](/pricing#compute-units), you pay for, you get a quota of 2 worker-gb-month.

Using a number of seats, workers, or memory greater than the terms of your subscription is technically possible, but if you do not adjust your subscription accordingly (via the [Customer Portal](#windmill-customer-portal)), we will ask you to take steps to correct this, with 3 options:
1. Our telemetry data may not be accurate or you do not understand it. In this case, please inform us or book a call: https://www.windmill.dev/ruben-30min
2. You need to re-arrange your use of Windmill. If so, please let us know that you need a period of adjustment that exceeds 35 days (validity of a license key), and feel free to contact us here or at support@windmill.dev so we can help you manage this.
3. Adjust your subscription via the [Customer Portal](#windmill-customer-portal).

Once excessive usage has been detected and we have informed you, your license key will cease to auto-renew (as it does by default every day). This leaves you with a period of 35 days (the validity period of a key) to make the necessary adjustments on your side. At the end of the term, Windmill Enterprise Edition will stop running your jobs.

	/>
</div>

#### Using the license key (self-host)

To enable the license key, switch from the `windmill` image to the `windmill-ee` image in both the server and workers. From the [Instance settings](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#license-key), pass the license key, "Test key" and save settings.

## AWS Marketplace

Windmill is available on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-pxlq6nidwn3lo). We are notified as soon as you have subscribed to a package, a Windmill representative will come to you to give you what you need to start your subscription: license key for the self-hosted EE package, access to dedicated instance for the cloud EE package.

If you have any questions, please contact support@windmill.dev

## Windmill Customer Portal

As an [Enterprise](/pricing) user, you will have access to detailed usage information and invoices through the [Windmill Customer Portal](https://portal.windmill.dev/). You can update contact information, billing details and subscription (seats & workers/compute units) from the portal. If you want to monitor live your usage, you can 'Send usage' from your [instance settings](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#telemetry) (if you have several instances, make sure to do it for each instance) and check how it converts into seats and compute units from the portal.

From the portal, you can adjust your subscription on your own. If you adjust your subscription during a billing cycle, you will be charged a prorated amount for the additional resources. This means you will only pay for the portion of the year that remains after the adjustment. For example on a yearly subscription, if you make the adjustment 10 months into the year, you would pay for approximately 2/12 of the annual cost for the additional resources.

![Portal](./portal.png 'Portal')

Access to the portal is made through either:
- From your [Instance settings](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#license-key), in the "Core" tab. Where you can also renew your [license key](#self-host).
- Through a direct link: [portal.windmill.dev](https://portal.windmill.dev/), filling in the email address used for the subscription, and then accessing a link sent by email. Only email addresses from the 'Contact emails' list can access the portal. You can add email addresses to the list by clicking on the "Update contact info" button in the portal.

</div>

![Custom link from the instance settings](./portal_link_instance.png 'Custom link from the instance settings')

<br/>

You can also enable/disable any time automatic renewal and automatic debit (if disabled, you will need to pay by invoice).

This is also from the portal that you can [manage your issues and feature requests](../12_support_and_sla/index.mdx#feature-request-and-issue-dashboard). Access to the Issues Dasboard is made throught the 'Authorized domains'. Anyone with an email address from the set domains will be able to login to the issues page.

Usage of your instance is reported on the platform - basic metrics such as Seats & workers are reported to Windmill. You can check whether your use of Windmill corresponds to your subscription, and report an error to Windmill if you wish. This comparison is made only for your instance of Prod, for which you can find the Base URL. The other instances URLs are also shown.

## Usage checks

Windmill employs lightweight telemetry to automatically track and report the usage of memory and seats for your subscription. Even on self-hosted plans, telemetry associated to your license key is reported to Windmill.

The following information is collected:
- version of your instance
- number and total duration of jobs
- accounts usage
- login type usage
- workers usage
- vCPUs usage
- memory usage
- superadmin email addresses

How the data is calculated:
- Seats: number of users (1 developer, or 2 operators) who are active (from logging in to running or deploying a script) on the platform in the last 30 days, according to the [audit logs](../../core_concepts/14_audit_logs/index.mdx). User count is across all instances (dev, prod) but Windmill only counts once the same user.
- Memory: we aggregate the limits of all production containers. Workers come in different sizes: small (1GB), standard (2GB), and large (> 2GB). For each compute unit, you pay for, you get a quota of 2 worker-gb-month. [Non-prod instances](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#non-prod-instance) are not counted in the billing for computation usage.

Using a number of seats, workers, or memory greater than the terms of your subscription is technically possible, but if you do not adjust your subscription accordingly (via the [Customer Portal](#windmill-customer-portal)), we will ask you to take steps to correct this, with 3 options:
1. Our telemetry data may not be accurate or you do not understand it. In this case, please inform us or book a call: https://www.windmill.dev/ruben-30min
2. You need to re-arrange your use of Windmill. If so, please let us know that you need a period of adjustment that exceeds 35 days (validity of a license key), and feel free to contact us here or at support@windmill.dev so we can help you manage this.
3. Adjust your subscription via the [Customer Portal](#windmill-customer-portal).

Once excessive usage has been detected and we have informed you, your license key will cease to auto-renew (as it does by default every day). This leaves you with a period of 35 days (the validity period of a key) to make the necessary adjustments on your side. At the end of the term, Windmill Enterprise Edition will stop running your jobs.

### Excessive usage

If the numbers we receive from telemetry exceeds the terms of the subscription on average at the end of the period, we will send you a warning to either clarify that it was a one-off exceptional event or to adjust your subscription. The key won't renew until clarification or adjustment is provided meaning there is a 35 days period to act on it before it will expire as it renews every day.
