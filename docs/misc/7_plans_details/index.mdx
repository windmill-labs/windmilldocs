## White Labeling Windmill

Windmill offers white labeling capabilities, allowing you to customize the Windmill platform to align with your brand. We do prodive a library to embed the entire Windmill app or specific components, such as the flow builder, into your own application or website. This enables you to provide Windmill's services to your clients while maintaining your brand's identity.

For more information about white labeling and customization options, please reach out to us at contact@windmill.dev, [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/V7PM2YHsPB), or schedule a [meeting](https://www.windmill.dev/book-demo).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **What is an operator?** An [operator](../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx) is a user who can only execute scripts, flows, and apps but cannot create or edit them.
- **What is an execution?** An execution corresponds to a single job with a duration of less than 1s. Additional computation is accounted for based on the duration of each job.
- **What is your Technical Support SLA?** We provide [support](../12_support_and_sla/index.mdx) with different response times based on issue priorities. Our support team is available 24/7, and the SLA is consistent for both Cloud and Self-hosted deployments.
- **What is your Security level on APIs?** Windmill is SOC 2 Type I compliant, and we prioritize addressing vulnerabilities promptly.
- **Could the application keep running if Windmill as a company is shut down?** Yes, Windmill will continue to operate as long as the license key remains valid, even in the absence of an internet connection.
