## Summary

Windmill emerged as the most balanced and versatile orchestrator. In normal mode, it excelled at long-running tasks with minimal overhead. In dedicated worker mode, it matched or surpassed the performance of Temporal and Hatchet for lightweight, parallel workloads. With smart caching, cold-start isolation, and adaptive behavior, it consistently delivered top-tier performance across runtimes and load types.

## Windmill setup

We set up Windmill version 1.483.1 using the [docker-compose.yml from the official GitHub repository](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill). We made some adjustments to it to have a similar setup compared to the other orchestrators.

We executed the Windmill benchmarks in both "normal" and "[dedicated worker](../../../../core_concepts/25_dedicated_workers/index.mdx)" mode. To implement the flows in Windmill, we first created a script simply computing the Fibonacci numbers:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    ```python
    # WIMDMILL script: `u/benchmarkuser/fibo_script`
    def fibo(n: int):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibo(n - 1) + fibo(n - 2)

def main(
    n: int,
):
    return fibo(n)
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="js" label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // WIMDMILL script: `u/benchmarkuser/fibo_script_ts`
    function fibo(n) {
      if (n <= 1) {
        return n
      } else {
        return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
      }
    }
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ts" label="Go">
    ```go
    // WIMDMILL script: `u/benchmarkuser/fibo_script_go`
    package inner

    func fibo(n int) int {
        if n <= 1 {
            return n
        } else {
            return fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
        }
    }

    func main(n int) (interface{}, error) {
        return fibo(n), nil
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

And then we used this script in a simple flow composed of a For-Loop sequentially executing the scripts. The JSON representation of the flow is as follow:

```yaml
summary: Fibonacci benchmark flow
description: Flow running 10 (resp. 40) times Fibonacci of 33 (resp. 10)
value:
  modules:
    - id: a
      value:
        type: forloopflow
        modules:
          - id: b
            value:
              path: u/admin/fibo_script # respectively u/admin/fibo_script_ts or u/admin/fibo_script_go
              type: script
              input_transforms:
                n:
                  type: static
                  value: 33 # respectively 10
        iterator:
          expr: Array(10) # respectively 40
          type: javascript
        parallel: false # respectively true for more than one worker
        skip_failures: true
schema:
  '$schema': https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
  properties: {}
  required: []
  type: object
```

When using more than one worker, we're also using the `parallel` parameter so that each iteration of the for-loop is executed in parallel. Under the hood, Windmill will spawn a sub-flow with a single job for each iteration.
