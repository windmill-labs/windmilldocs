# S3 streaming for large queries

Sometimes, your SQL script will return too much data which exceeds the 10 000 rows query limit within Windmill. In this case, you
will want to use the s3 flag to stream your query result to a file. You will need to have workspace storage enabled for this.

```sql
-- s3 prefix=datalake format=csv
SELECT id, created_at FROM users
```

This will return a path string to the generated file which has the job id as its name, for example in this case:
`"datalake/0196c8e6-1fd4-0d05-d31c-c7eae9a12b1a.csv"`

All parameters are optional :

- prefix : adds a prefix to the object key of the generated file. Default: wmill_datalake/path/to/job/id
- format : json (default), csv or parquet
- storage : name of the secondary workspace storage to use
