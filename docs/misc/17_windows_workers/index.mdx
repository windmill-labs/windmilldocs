# Windows workers

Windows Native Workers are a [Self-Hosted Enterprise](/pricing) Feature.

You can use the Windows worker natively if you do not want to run Docker or WSL on Windows (e.g., for policy or security reasons).
This feature supports the **Python**, **Bun**, and **PowerShell** executors.

You can connect Windows workers to your existing Dockerized or cloud self-hosted PostgreSQL database and Windmill server.

### Setting up Windmill worker executable

1. **Set up a working directory**:
   - Create a directory from where you want to run the Windmill worker, e.g., `C:\Users\Alex\windmill`.

2. **Download Windmill executable**:
   - Download the `windmill-ee.exe` file into the newly created directory from the [releases page](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases).

3. **Set basic environment variables**:
   - Set the following [environment variables](../../core_concepts/47_environment_variables/index.mdx) (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:MODE="worker"
     $env:DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:changeme@172.12.0.1:5432/windmill?sslmode=disable"
     $env:SKIP_MIGRATION="true"
     ```
     More environment variables and worker settings can be found [here](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables).

4. **Run windmill-ee.exe**:
   ```powershell
   PS C:\Users\Alex\windmill> .\windmill-ee.exe
   ```
   We recommend running Windmill as a service on your Windows environment using `sc` or `NSSM` to monitor the Windmill worker, start it at system boot, and manage the restart policy.

After the basic setup, follow these steps for each language your worker should support.

### Python executor

1. **Install uv**:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
You can also check other installation methods in uv`s [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Bun executor

1. **Install Bun**: Follow the official [documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) for Windows.
2. **Locate Bun installation**:
   - Find where Bun is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     where.exe bun
     ```
     Example output:
     ```plaintext
     C:\Users\Alex\.bun\bin\bun.exe
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:BUN_PATH="C:\Users\Alex\.bun\bin\bun.exe"
     ```

### PowerShell executor

1. **Install PowerShell 7+ (stable)**: Ensure you have the latest stable release of PowerShell by following the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows).
   - Start PowerShell 7 and verify you're running PowerShell 7 by checking `$PSVersionTable`:
     ```powershell
     $PSVersionTable
     PSVersion 7.4.5
     ```

2. **Locate PowerShell 7 installation**:
   - Find where PowerShell 7 is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     where.exe pwsh.exe # Note: previous versions used powershell.exe
     ```
     Example output:
     ```plaintext
     C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:POWERSHELL_PATH="C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"
     ```
