# Windows workers

Windows workers enable you to run Windmill scripts and flows directly on Windows machines without requiring Docker or WSL, supporting Python, Bun, PowerShell, C#, and Nu executors for native Windows execution.

Windows Native Workers are a [Self-Hosted Enterprise](/pricing) feature.

You can connect Windows workers to your existing Dockerized or cloud self-hosted PostgreSQL database and Windmill server.

### Setting up Windmill worker executable

1. **Set up a working directory**:
   - Create a directory from where you want to run the Windmill worker, e.g., `C:\Users\Alex\windmill`.

2. **Download Windmill executable**:
   - Download the `windmill-ee.exe` file into the newly created directory from the [releases page](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/releases).

3. **Set basic environment variables**:
   - Set the following [environment variables](../../core_concepts/47_environment_variables/index.mdx) (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:MODE="worker"
     $env:DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:changeme@172.12.0.1:5432/windmill?sslmode=disable"
     $env:SKIP_MIGRATION="true"
     ```
     More environment variables and worker settings can be found [here](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables).

4. **Run windmill-ee.exe**:
   ```powershell
   PS C:\Users\Alex\windmill> .\windmill-ee.exe
   ```
   We recommend running Windmill as a service on your Windows environment using `sc` or `NSSM` to monitor the Windmill worker, start it at system boot, and manage the restart policy.

After the basic setup, follow these steps for each language your worker should support.

### Python executor

1. **Install uv**:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
You can also check other installation methods in uv`s [official documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Bun executor

1. **Install Bun**: Follow the official [documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) for Windows.
2. **Locate Bun installation**:
   - Find where Bun is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     where.exe bun
     ```
     Example output:
     ```plaintext
     C:\Users\Alex\.bun\bin\bun.exe
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:BUN_PATH="C:\Users\Alex\.bun\bin\bun.exe"
     ```
### PowerShell executor
1. **Install PowerShell 7+ (stable)**: Ensure you have the latest stable release of PowerShell by following the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows).
   - Start PowerShell 7 and verify you're running PowerShell 7 by checking `$PSVersionTable`:
     ```powershell
     $PSVersionTable
     PSVersion 7.4.5
     ```

2. **Locate PowerShell 7 installation**:
   - Find where PowerShell 7 is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     where.exe pwsh.exe # Note: previous versions used powershell.exe
     ```
     Example output:
     ```plaintext
     C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:POWERSHELL_PATH="C:\Program Files\PowerShell\7\pwsh.exe"
     ```

### C# executor

1. **Install .NET 9.0 SDK**: Follow [Microsoft instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows) and make sure you have .NET 9.0 installed.
   - You can check it by listing the installed SDKs:
     ```powershell
     dotnet --list-sdks
     ```
2. **Locate your .NET installation**:
   - Find where .NET is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     where.exe dotnet
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace with your values if needed):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:DOTNET_ROOT="C:\Program Files\dotnet"
     $env:DOTNET_PATH="C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe"
     ```


### Nu executor

1. **Nu**: Ensure you have installed Nu by following the [official documentation](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html#package-managers).
   - Start PowerShell and verify you can enter Nushell:
     ```powershell
     nu
     ```

2. **Locate Nu installation**:
   - Find where Nu is installed by running:
     ```powershell
     where.exe nu.exe 
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration
     $env:NU_PATH="C:\..\..\nu.exe"
     ```
### Java executor

1. **Install Java**: Ensure you have installed Java. You can use any Java version, but OpenJDK-22 is recommended and tested by Windmill.
   - Start PowerShell and verify you have working `java` and `javac`:
     ```powershell
     java --version && javac --version
     ```

2. **Install Coursier**:
   - Open PowerShell and fetch .jar:
     ```powershell
      Start-BitsTransfer -Source https://github.com/coursier/launchers/raw/master/coursier -Destination coursier
     ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   - Add the following environment variables (replace the placeholders with your specific values):
     ```powershell
     # Replace these variables with your specific configuration.
     # Make sure you provide **full** path!
     $env:COURSIER_PATH="C:\..\..\coursier"
     ```

### Ruby executor

1. **Install Ruby**: For Ruby you will need to have `ruby.exe`, `bundler.bat` and `gem.cmd` in `PATH`. You can use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/) for this.
   - Start PowerShell and verify you have working executables:
     ```powershell
     ruby --version && bundler --version && gem --version
     ```
