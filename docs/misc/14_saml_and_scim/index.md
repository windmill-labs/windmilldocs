# SAML & SCIM

Setting up SAML and SCIM allows you to authenticate users using your identity provider.

This feature is available under [Enterprise Edition](/pricing). Configuration is set from [Instance settings](../../advanced/18_instance_settings/index.mdx#scimsaml)

## SAML

The entity ID is `windmill`

ACS Url is `<instance_url>/api/saml/acs`
SCIM connector is `<instance_url>/api/scim`
Application username format is `Email`

![Instance settings UI](instance_settings.png)

In the Instance settings UI, pass the SAML Metadata URL (or content) containing the metadata URL (or XML content).

:::tip

You can control the entity ID using the `SAML_AUDIENCE` environment variable. This can be useful if you want to use the same identity provider for multiple instances (e.g dev / prod).

### Okta

Configure Okta with the following settings (and replace cf.wimill.xyz with your domain):

In the Instance settings UI, pass the SAML Metadata URL (or content) containing the metadata URL (or XML content).

### Microsoft Azure

In the Azure portal, go to "Enterprise Applications" and create a new one of type "Non-gallery".

Once the application is created, in the application's page go to "Single sign-on" on the left menu, and click on the "SAML" button.

Edit the configuration to set the Entity ID to `windmill` and the ACS url to `<instance_url>/api/saml/acs`.

Copy the App Federation Metadata URL and paste it in the Instance settings UI.

If for some reasons, the metadata URL cannot be used, you can copy the XML content and paste it in the field instead.

Once it's saved, you can test the login by clicking on the `Test` button at the bottom, then on the drawer `Test sign in`.

## SCIM

### Okta

Configure Okta with the following settings (and replace cf.wimill.xyz with your domain):

:::warning
The `/api/scim` endpoint of your windmill instance needs to be exposed to the internet for Okta to push groups/users to your windmill instance.

In the Instance settings UI, choose a random secure string as a SCIM token that you will set in the Okta SCIM connection setting's "Authentication Mode -> HTTP Header".

### Microsoft Azure

Create an application from the "Enterprise Applications" menu (see [Configuring SAML with Microsoft Azure](#microsoft-azure)). Once the application is created, in the application's page go to "Provisioning" on the left menu, and click on the "Get started" button.

![Azure SCIM](azure-scim-new_application.png)

Choose the "Automatic" provisioning mode, and then for the Tenant URL, input the public URL of your Windmill server with the prefix `/api/scim`.

![Azure SAML metadata](azure_saml_metadata.png)

Copy the App Federation Metadata URL and paste it in the Instance settings UI.

![Instance settings UI](instance_settings.png)

In the Instance settings UI, set the SCIM token containing the secret value that you will share to Azure. You can click "Test" in Windmill's Instance settings UI to validate the SAML metadata URL/Content.

You can then click on the Test Connection button to validate Azure can connect to Windmill's SCIM endpoint. You can then choose to sync only the Users and Groups assigned to this application, or all users and groups. Note that if you choose the former, after you save, go to the application's page and click on the "Users and groups" button in the left menu bar. Only the users and groups present here will be synced to Windmill.

![Azure SCIM](azure-scim-application_provisioning.png)

Once this is done, you can click on the Save button at the top left. Azure will now synchronize users and groups approximately every 40 minutes.

### In Windmill

Once setup, the groups page should contain a new section:

![New section SCIM](okta-scim-groups.png.webp)

## Instance groups

When SCIM is properly configured, groups from your identity provider will be automatically synchronized to Windmill as **instance groups**. These are special groups that:

- Are automatically managed by your identity provider (no manual creation needed)
- Sync users and group memberships automatically
- Can be used across multiple workspaces within your instance
- Provide enterprise-level group management without manual provisioning

Instance groups appear in your Windmill groups interface with a special designation, and can be assigned permissions to folders and resources just like regular groups. This eliminates the need for manual group management while maintaining full integration with Windmill's permission system.

For more details about how to use instance groups within your workflows and permission structure, see [Groups and folders](../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx#instance-groups).
