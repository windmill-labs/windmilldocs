# Support & SLA

Windmill provides dedicated support and service level agreements (SLAs) to ensure timely assistance and address any issues that may arise during your usage of the platform.

## Technical support

Our knowledgeable support team is available 24/7 to assist you with any technical inquiries, troubleshooting, or questions you may have. We are committed to providing timely responses and resolutions to ensure a seamless experience with Windmill.

## Issue prioritization

To effectively handle and prioritize issues, we categorize them into different priority levels based on their impact and urgency. This enables us to allocate resources efficiently and ensure that critical issues receive immediate attention. Issues are tracked through private issues boards and bug trackers, such as GitHub ones.

- P0 (Priority 0): Reserved for blocking and urgent issues that require immediate resolution.
- P1 (Priority 1): High-priority issues that significantly impact functionality or performance.
- P2 (Priority 2): Medium-priority issues that have a moderate impact on functionality.
- P3 (Priority 3): Low-priority issues that have minimal impact on functionality or usability.

## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

Our SLA defines the expected response times for each priority level:

- P0: Response within 3 hours.
- P1: Response within 24 hours.
- P2: Response within 48 hours.
- P3: Response within 72 hours.

## Support level for each plan

- **Community**: Basic support is available for users on the Community plan. Response times may vary, and priority is given to higher-tier plans.
- **Team & Pro**: Users on the Team & Pro plans receive Priority Support 24/7. Our goal is to respond within 48 hours and provide assistance from our automation engineers.
- **Enterprise**: Customers on the Enterprise plan enjoy the highest level of support. They receive Priority Support 24/7 with a 3-hour response time and benefit from dedicated assistance from our automation engineers.
