## Installation

### Create an EKS cluster

On your AWS console, navigate to the EKS service and create a new cluster.

### Create an RDS instance

On your AWS console, navigate to the RDS service and create a new instance.

You will also have to create a new security group that allows inbound access on port 5432 from the subnets of the EKS cluster. Furthermore, you will have to create the windmill database using the postgres command `CREATE DATABASE windmill;`.

Test if you can connect to the database from your EKS cluster by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl run psql --image=postgres --rm -i -t -- bash

psql -h <rds-instance-address> -U postgres -d windmill
```

### Install Windmill

Open a terminal and run the following command to connect to your EKS cluster:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster-name> --region <region>
```

Update the values.yaml file with your desired configuration, specifically the database credentials and endpoint.

Then, run the following command to install Windmill:

```bash
helm install windmill windmill/windmill --namespace windmill --create-namespace
```

Check if the installation was successful by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n windmill
```

If all the pods are running, you can access the Windmill UI by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/windmill-service 8080:8080 -n windmill
```

Then, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the Windmill UI.

If you any issues, you can check the logs of the pods by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl logs -n windmill -l app=windmill #or the specific pod name that has the issue
```

More information about the configuration of windmill can be found in the [helm chart repo](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-helm-charts).
