# Custom HTTP routes

Windmill supports custom HTTP routes to trigger a script or flow. 
They can only be created by workspace admins. 
All properties of the route apart from the http path can be modified by any user with write access to the route.

## How to use

Create a new route on the HTTP routes page.
Specify the path of the http route. You can use the `:param` syntax to define parameters.
Parameters can be handler using a preprocessor, see [below](#preprocessor).
You also need to select the method of the route (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE).

The full http route takes the following form:
- Self-hosted Windmill: `{base_url}/api/r/{path}`
- Windmill Cloud: `https://app.windmill.dev/api/r/{workspace_id}/{path}`

Select the runnable that should be triggered by this route. To quickly get started, you can use the `create from template` button to generate a runnable template.

The route also supports additional configuration options:
- **Request type**: Whether the route should return the id (async) or the result (sync) of the runnable.
- **Authentication**: Whether the route should require authentication. If authentication is required, the user needs to have read access to both the route and the runnable.


## Preprocessor

Scripts and flows can include a preprocessor to transform incoming requests before they are passed to the runnable.
The preprocessor is only called when the runnable is triggered via an HTTP route, a webhook or an email trigger.
This is useful for handling headers, query/path parameters, or modifying arguments before execution.
Using a preprocessor also separates the handling of arguments according to whether they are called by a trigger (http, email or webhook) or from the UI, which can help you keep a simple schema form in the UI for the runnable.

Preprocessors can only be written in TypeScript (Bun/Deno) or Python.

### Script preprocessor

In scripts, you need to export an additional `preprocessor` function. It takes a special argument called `wm_trigger` in addition to the request body arguments and should return the transformed arguments for the main function of the script.
The `wm_trigger` contains the kind of the trigger (http, email or webhook) and an http object with the details of the request when the script is triggered via an HTTP route.

Here are examples of a preprocessor function in TypeScript and Python:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```TypeScript
export async function preprocessor(
	wm_trigger: {
		kind: 'http' | 'email' | 'webhook',
		http?: {
			route: string // The route path, e.g. "/users/:id"
			path: string // The actual path called, e.g. "/users/123"
			method: string
			params: Record<string, string>
			query: Record<string, string>
			headers: Record<string, string>
		}
	},
	/* your other args from the request body */ 
) {
	return {
		// return the args to be passed to the main function
	}
}

export async function main(/* main args */) {
    // your code here
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Python">
```Python
from typing import TypedDict, Literal

class Http(TypedDict):
	route: str # The route path, e.g. "/users/:id"
	path: str # The actual path called, e.g. "/users/123"
	method: str
	params: dict[str, str]
	query: dict[str, str]
	headers: dict[str, str]

class WmTrigger(TypedDict):
    kind: Literal["http", "email", "webhook"]
    http: Http | None

def preprocessor(
	wm_trigger: WmTrigger,
	# your other args from the request body
):
	return {
		# return the args to be passed to the main function
	}

def main(/* main args */):
    # your code here
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once a preprocessor is created, you should see a new tab in the right panel of the editor that allows you to test the preprocessor with a sample request.

![Test script preprocessor](./test_script_preprocessor.png 'Test script preprocessor')    

### Flow preprocessor 

For flows, the idea is similar but the preprocessor is a standalone step that returns only a `preprocessor` function.
To create a preprocessor for a flow, click on the plus button above the `Input` step:

![Add flow preprocessor](./add_flow_preprocessor.png 'Add flow preprocessor')    

The flow preprocessor takes the same arguments as the script preprocessor and should return the transformed arguments for the flow:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```TypeScript
export async function preprocessor(
	wm_trigger: {
		kind: 'http' | 'email' | 'webhook',
		http?: {
			route: string // The route path, e.g. "/users/:id"
			path: string // The actual path called, e.g. "/users/123"
			method: string
			params: Record<string, string>
			query: Record<string, string>
			headers: Record<string, string>
		}
	},
	/* your other args from the request body */ 
) {
	return {
		// return the args to be passed to the flow
	}
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Python">
```Python
from typing import TypedDict, Literal

class Http(TypedDict):
	route: str # The route path, e.g. "/users/:id"
	path: str # The actual path called, e.g. "/users/123"
	method: str
	params: dict[str, str]
	query: dict[str, str]
	headers: dict[str, str]

class WmTrigger(TypedDict):
    kind: Literal["http", "email", "webhook"]
    http: Http | None

def preprocessor(
	wm_trigger: WmTrigger,
	# your other args from the request body
):
	return {
		# return the args to be passed to the flow
	}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
