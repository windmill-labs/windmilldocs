# Ducklake

Ducklake allows you to store massive amounts of data in S3, but still query it efficiently using DuckDB in natural SQL language.

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- A workspace storage configured
- A Postgres or MySQL resource (Optional for superusers)

Superusers can use the Windmill database as a catalog for Ducklake with no additional configuration.

Go to `workspace settings` -> `Object storage (S3)` and configure a Ducklake :

![Ducklake settings](./ducklake_settings.png 'Ducklake settings')

Clicking the "Explore" button will open the database manager. Your ducklake behaves like any other database : you can perform all CRUD operations through the UI or with the SQL Repl. You can also create and delete new tables.

![Explore ducklake](./ducklake_db_manager.png 'Explore ducklake')

If you explore your catalog database, you will see that Ducklake created some tables for you :

![Catalog database](./ducklake_catalog_db.png 'Catalog database')

These metadata tables store information about your data and where it is located in S3.
If you go to your workspace storage settings, you can explore your selected workspace storage at the configured location and see your tables and their contents :

![S3 content](./ducklake_s3_content.png 'S3 content')

## Using Ducklake in DuckDB scripts

Ducklakes can be accessed in DuckDB scripts using the `ATTACH` syntax. You can use the Ducklake button in the editor bar for convenience.

In the example below, we pass a list of messages with positive, neutral or negative sentiment.  
This list might come from a Python script which queries new reviews from the Google My Business API,
and sends them to an LLM to determine their sentiment.  
The messages are then inserted into a Ducklake table, which effectively creates a new parquet file.

```sql
-- $messages (json[])

ATTACH 'ducklake://main' AS dl;
USE dl;

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS messages (
  content STRING NOT NULL,
  author STRING NOT NULL,
  date STRING NOT NULL,
  sentiment STRING
);

CREATE TEMP TABLE new_messages AS
  SELECT
    value->>'content' AS content,
    value->>'author' AS author,
    value->>'date' AS date,
    value->>'sentiment' AS sentiment
  FROM json_each($messages);

INSERT INTO messages
  SELECT * FROM new_messages;
```
