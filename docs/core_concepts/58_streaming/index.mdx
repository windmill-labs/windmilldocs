# Streaming

Windmill supports streaming data from jobs in several ways. Runnables can return streams (any `AsyncGenerator<string>` in TypeScript, `iter` in Python, or an AI agent step), and Windmill provides multiple ways to consume them.

## Job result streaming

Scripts in Python and TypeScript can stream back results as a text stream. The stream exists while the job is running, and the full content becomes the result once the job completes.

</div>


## AI agent streaming

AI agent steps support streaming token deltas, tool calls and tool results as structured JSON payloads.

## Consuming a stream

### Webhook SSE stream

Runnables are associated with SSE stream webhook endpoints that trigger the job and return a Server-Sent Events stream.

	/>
</div>

### HTTP trigger SSE stream

HTTP routes can be configured in Sync SSE mode to return a Server-Sent Events stream when the bound runnable returns a stream.
