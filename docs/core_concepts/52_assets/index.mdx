# Assets

Windmill auto detects when you reference assets directly in your code. Assets are referenced with URIs and include:

- S3 Objects : s3://storage/path/to/file.csv
- Resources : res://path/to/resource
- Variables : var://path/to/variable

![Assets in script editor](./assets_in_script_editor.png 'Assets in script editor')

As of writing this, assets are supported for the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- DuckDB

When the asset is a database resource or an S3 file, an explore button will appear next to the asset.

Read / Write mode is infered from code context.
For example, a `COPY (...) TO file` statement is always `Write`.
Sometimes the Read / Write mode cannot be inferred, in which case you are able to manually select it.

You can use the Add Resource / Variable / S3 Object buttons in the editor bar for convenience :

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
	autoPlay
	controls
	id="main-video"
	src="/videos/assets_demo.mp4"
/>
<br />

The python and Typescript/Javascript clients now support the new URI syntax :

```python
wmill.get_resource('res://path/to/resource')
wmill.get_variable('var://path/to/variable')
wmill.load_s3_file('s3://storage/path/to/file.csv')

# Not using the URI syntax still works for back-compatibility,
# and is detected as an asset
wmill.load_s3_file('storage/path/to/file.csv')
```

## Asset nodes in flows

In flows, your assets will show up as asset nodes, making data flow easy to visualize :

![Asset nodes](./asset_nodes.png 'Asset nodes')

The Read/Write mode is used to show the asset as an input or output node.

When running a flow and passing an asset as an input, it will appear as an input of the flow in the preview graph :

![Flow input assets](./flow_input_assets.png 'Flow input assets')

## Tracking where your assets are used

Assets are stored in the database upon script / flow deployment.
You can see a list of all assets used in your workspace by going to the Assets tab in the sidebar.

Clicking on the `usages` link will show the list of scripts and flows that use the asset.
