# Monitor Past and Future Runs

Each workspace has a dedicated Runs menu that allows you to visualise all past and future runs.

## Aggregated View

The Runs menu in each workspace provides a time series view where you can monitor different time slots.
The green (respectively, red) dots being the tasks that succeeded (respectively, failed).

> All past and future runs of the workspace are visible from the menu.

## Details per Run

Clicking on each run in the menu opens a run page where you can view the run's state, inputs, and success/failure reasons.

![Details per run](./2-detail-per-run.png 'Details per run')

> View of a past run.

<br />

You can also view [scheduled](../1_scheduling/index.mdx) runs from the run menu, which provides information on the arguments used and the next trigger.

View of a scheduled run:

> Although scheduled scripts and flows are visible on their [dedicated tab](../1_scheduling/index.mdx), the run menu helps you see the next scheduled one.

## Filters

You can adjust the level of details by picking playing with filters on:

- **Datetime**
- **Metadata**: [Path](../16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx#path) / User / Folder
- **Kind**: All / Runs / Previews / Dependencies
- **Status**: All / Success / Failure
- **Skipped flows**
- **Arguments**
- **Results**

Example of filters in use:

> Here were filtered successful runs from August 2023 which returned `{"baseNumber": 11}`.
