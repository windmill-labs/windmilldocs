# Persistent storage & databases

Persistent storage refers to any method of storing data that remains intact and accessible even after a system is powered off, restarted, or experiences a crash.

In the context of Windmill, the stakes are: **where to effectively store and manage the data manipulated by Windmill** (ETL, data ingestion and preprocessing, data migration and sync etc.) ?

:::info TLDR

We recommend using **data tables** to store relational data, and **ducklakes** to store massive datasets.
Alternatively, you can connect your own database or S3 storage as a [resource](../3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

<br />

This present document gives a list of trusted services to use alongside Windmill.

:::

<br />

There are 5 kinds of persistent storage in Windmill:

1. [Data tables](#data-tables) for out-of-the-box relational data storage.

2. [Ducklakes](#ducklake) for data lakehouse storage.

3. [Small data](#within-windmill-not-recommended) that is relevant in between script/flow execution and can be persisted on Windmill itself.

4. [Object storage for large data](#large-data-s3-r2-minio-azure-blob-google-cloud-storage) such as S3.

5. [Big structured SQL data](#structured-sql-data-postgres-supabase-neontech) that is critical to your services and that is stored externally on an SQL Database or Data Warehouse.

6. [NoSQL and document database](#nosql--document-databases-mongodb-key-value-stores) such as MongoDB and Key-Value stores.

## Data tables

You can setup data tables directly within Windmill to store relational data, without needing to connect an external database.

		description="Near-zero setup relational database."
		href="/docs/core_concepts/persistent_storage/data_tables"
	/>
</div>

## Ducklake

Ducklake allows you to store massive amounts of data in parquet files on S3 while querying it with natural SQL syntax.
Windmill offers first-class Ducklake integration to store large datasets in a data lakehouse format.

		href="/docs/core_concepts/persistent_storage/ducklake"
	/>
</div>

## You already have your own database

If you already have your own database provided by a supported integration, you can easily connect it to Windmill.

If your service provider is already part of [our list of integrations](../../integrations/0_integrations_on_windmill.mdx), just add your database as a [resource](../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx).

If your service provider is not already integrated with Windmill, you can create a [new resource type](../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx#create-a-resource-type) to establish the connection (and if you want, [share the schema on our Hub](../../misc/1_share_on_hub/index.md)).

## Within Windmill: not recommended

There are however internal methods to persist data between executions of jobs.

	/>
</div>

## Large data: S3, R2, MinIO, Azure Blob, Google Cloud Storage

On heavier data objects & unstructured data storage, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) and its alternatives [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) as well as [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs) and [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) are highly scalable and durable object storage services that provide secure, reliable, and cost-effective storage for a wide range of data types and use cases.

Windmill comes with a [native integration with S3, Azure Blob, and Google Cloud Storage](./large_data_files.mdx), making them the recommended storage for large objects like files and binary data.

## Structured SQL data: Postgres (Supabase, Neon.tech)

For Postgres databases (best for structured data storage and retrieval, where you can define schema and relationships between entities), we recommend using Supabase or Neon.tech.

## NoSQL & Document databases (Mongodb, Key-Value Stores)

Key-value stores are a popular choice for managing non-structured data, providing a flexible and scalable solution for various data types and use cases. In the context of Windmill, you can use MongoDB Atlas, Redis, and Upstash to store and manipulate non-structured data effectively.
