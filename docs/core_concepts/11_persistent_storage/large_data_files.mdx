# Large data: S3, R2, MinIO, Azure Blob

This page is part of our section on [Persistent storage & databases](./index.mdx) which covers where to effectively store and manage the data manipulated by Windmill. Check that page for more options on data storage.

On heavier data objects & unstructured data storage, [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service) and its alternatives [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/r2/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/) as well as [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs) are highly scalable and durable object storage service that provides secure, reliable, and cost-effective storage for a wide range of data types and use cases.

Windmill comes with a [native integration with S3 and Azure Blob](../38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx), making it the recommended storage for large objects like files and binary data.

## Workspace object storage

Connect your Windmill workspace to your S3 bucket or your Azure Blob storage to enable users to read and write from S3 without having to have access to the credentials.

Windmill S3 bucket browser will not work for buckets containing more than 20 files and uploads are limited to files < 50MB. Consider upgrading to Windmill [Enterprise Edition](/pricing) to use this feature with large buckets.

## Windmill integration with Polars and DuckDB for data pipelines

ETLs can be easily implemented in Windmill using its integration with Polars and DuckDB for facilitate working with tabular data. In this case, you don't need to manually interact with the S3 bucket, Polars/DuckDB does it natively and in a efficient way. Reading and Writing datasets to S3 can be done seamlessly.

```sql
-- $file1 (s3object)

-- Run queries directly on an S3 parquet file passed as an argument
SELECT * FROM read_parquet($file1)

-- Or using an explicit path in a workspace storage
SELECT * FROM read_json('s3:///demo/data.json')

-- You can also specify a secondary workspace storage
SELECT * FROM read_csv('s3://secondary_storage/demo/data.csv')

-- Write the result of a query to a different parquet file on S3
COPY (
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet($file1)
) TO 's3:///demo/output.pq' (FORMAT 'parquet');

:::info

Polars and DuckDB need to be configured to access S3 within the Windmill script. The job will need to accessed the S3 resources, which either needs to be accessible to the user running the job, or the S3 resource needs to be [set as public in the workspace settings](../38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#workspace-object-storage).

## Use Amazon S3, R2, MinIO and Azure Blob directly

Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2 and MinIO all follow the same API schema and therefore have a [common Windmill resource type](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/42/). Azure Blob has a slightly different API than S3 but works with Windmill as well using its dedicated [resource type](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/137/)
