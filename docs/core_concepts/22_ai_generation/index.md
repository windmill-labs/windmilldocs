# AI Generation

Windmill provides ways to have AI help you in your coding experience.

:::info OpenAI Integration

If you're interested leveraging OpenAI from your scripts, flows and apps, check [OpenAI Integration](../../integrations/openai.md).

## Code Generation

Generate Windmill-specific code from simple text.

/>

<br/>

On the workspace settings, go to the "OpenAI Credentials" tab and add an [OpenAI resource](../../integrations/openai.md).

:::caution

Code generation on Windmill from OpenAI only works on GPT-4 so far.

:::

Then from a code editor (Script, Flow, Apps), click on `AI Gen` and write with a prompt what the script should do. The script will use Windmill's main requirements and features (exposing a main function, importing libraries, using resource types, declaring required parameters with types, leveraging database schema).

## Code Auto-Completion with Codium

[Codeium](https://codeium.com/) is a code acceleration toolkit built on AI technology. In particular, Codeium has a free [browser extension](https://codeium.com/download) that works as a code completion assistant.

Here is how to install the extension on Chrome (details [here](https://codeium.com/chrome_tutorial)):

1. Install the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codeium-ai-code-autocompl/hobjkcpmjhlegmobgonaagepfckjkceh).
2. Sign in to Codeium using an e-mail or Google.
3. If it works, you should see the Codeium extension turn green.
4. To have it work on Windmill, add it to your Codeium allowlist:
   - Click on Codeium extension icon.
   - Select `Open Options Page`.
   - In the Allowlist, write `https:\/\/app\.windmill\.dev\/.*` (or your domain, if self-hosting).
   - `Save Allowlist`.

Now you're good to have Codeium suggest code in Windmill's code editor (scripts, flows, apps).

The code will auto-suggest, and if you like it, press on `tab` to accept.

You can help it by giving proper functions names:

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    controls
    src="/videos/codeium_function.mp4"
/>

<br/>

Or by writing comments:

<video
    className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full h-full dark:border-gray-800"
    controls
    src="/videos/codeium_comments.mp4"
/>

<br/>

:::caution

Please note that the code suggested by Codeidum is not specific to Windmill and therefore does not necessarily meet its requirements (exposing a main function and declaring dependencies in the same file).
