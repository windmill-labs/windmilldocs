# Resources and Resource Types

Resources are rich objects in JSON that allow to store configuration and credentials.

In Windmill, Resources represent connections to third party systems. Resources are a good way to define a
connection to a frequently used third party system such as a database. Think of
Resources as a structured way to store configuration and credentials, and access them from scripts.

Each Resource has a **Resource Type** (**RT** for short) - for example [MySQL](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/111/mysql),
[MongoDB](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/22/mongodb), [OpenAI](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/61/openai), etc. - that defines the schema that the resource of this type
needs to implement. Schemas implement the
[JSON Schema specification](https://json-schema.org/).

Check our [list of integrations](../../integrations/0_integrations_on_windmill.mdx) (or, pre-made resource types). If one is missing, this very page details how to [create your own](#create-a-resource-type).

## Create a Resource

To create a resource using an existing type, go to the
[Resources](https://app.windmill.dev/resources) page and click "Add a
resource/API".

![Add a resource](./add_resource.png)

Just like most objects in Windmill, Resources have a path that define their
permissions - see [ownership path prefix](../16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx).

Each **Resource** has a **Resource Type**, that defines what fields that
resource contains. Select one from the list and check the schema to see what
fields are present.

![Add resource example](./add_sf_resource.png)

Resources commonly need to access secrets or re-use
[Variables](../2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx), for example passwords or API
tokens. To insert a Variable into a Resource, use **Insert variable** (the `$`
sign button) and select a Variable. The name of a Variable will look like
`$VAR:<NAME_OF_VAR>`. When resources are called from a Script, the Variable
reference will be replaced by its value.

:::tip

It's a good practice to **link a script template to Resources**, so that users can
easily get started with it. You can use markdown in the description field to add
a link, for example:

```md
[example script with this resource](/scripts/add?template=script/template/path)
```

## Create a Resource Type

Windmill comes preloaded with some common Resource Types, such as databases, apps, SMTP, etc. You can see the full list on [Windmill Hub](https://hub.windmill.dev/resources). You
can also add custom Resource Types by clicking "Add a resource type" on the
[Resources](https://app.windmill.dev/resources) page.

![Create resource type](./add_resource_type.png)

Use the "Add Property" button to add a field to the resource type. You can
specify constraints for the field (a type, making it mandatory, specifying a
default, etc). You can also view the schema by toggling the "As JSON" option:

## States

States are used by scripts to keep data persistent between runs of the same script by the same trigger (schedule or user).

In Windmill, states are considered as resources, but they are excluded from the Workspace tab for clarity.
They are displayed on the Resources menu, under a dedicated tab.

A state is an object stored as a resource of the resource type `state` which is meant to persist across distinct executions of the same script.

```py
import requests
from wmill import set_state, get_state

def main():
	# Get temperature from last execution
    last_temperature = get_state()

    # Fetch the temperature in Paris from wttr.in
    response = requests.get("http://wttr.in/Paris?format=%t")

    new_temperature = response.text.strip("Â°F")

	# Set current temperature to state
    set_state(new_temperature)

    # Compare last_temperature and new_temperature
    if last_temperature < new_temperature:
        return "The temperature has increased."
    elif last_temperature > new_temperature:
        return "The temperature has decreased."
    else:
        return "The temperature has remained the same."
```

States are what enable Flows to watch for changes in most event watching scenarios ([trigger scripts](../../flows/10_flow_trigger.mdx)). The pattern is as follows:

- Retrieve the last state or, if undefined, assume it is the first execution.
- Retrieve the current state in the external system you are watching, e.g. the
  list of users having starred your repo or the maximum ID of posts on Hacker News.
- Calculate the difference between the current state and the last internal
  state. This difference is what you will want to act upon.
- Set the new state as the current state so that you do not process the
  elements you just processed.
- Return the differences calculated previously so that you can process them in
  the next steps. You will likely want to [forloop](../../flows/12_flow_loops.md) over the items and trigger
  one Flow per item. This is exactly the pattern used when your Flow is in the
  mode of "Watching changes regularly".

The convenience functions do this are:

*TypeScript*

- `getState()` which retrieves an object of any type (internally a simple
  Resource) at a path determined by `getStatePath`, which is unique to the user
  currently executing the Script, the Flow in which it is currently getting
  called in - if any - and the path of the Script.
- `setState(value: any)` which sets the new state.

> Please note it requires [importing](../../advanced/6_imports/index.md) the wmill client library from Deno/Bun.

<br/>

*Python*

- `get_state()` which retrieves an object of any type (internally a simple
  Resource) at a path determined by `get_state_path`, which is unique to the user
  currently executing the Script, the Flow in which it is currently getting
  called in - if any - and the path of the Script.
- `set_state(value: Any)` which sets the new state.

> Please note it requires [importing](../../advanced/6_imports/index.md) the wmill client library from Python.

### Fetching them from within a script by using the wmill client in the respective language

By clicking on `+ Resource`, you'll get to pick a resource from your workspace and be able to fetch it from within the script.

Typescript:

```typescript
wmill.getResource('u/user/foo');
```

Python:

```python
wmill.get_resource("u/user/foo")
```

Go:

```go
wmill.GetResource("u/user/foo")
```

Bash:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $WM_TOKEN" \
  "$BASE_INTERNAL_URL/api/w/$WM_WORKSPACE/resources/get/u/user/foo" \
    | jq -r .value
```
