# Audit Logs

Windmill provides audit logs for every operation and action that has side-effects. These logs capture the user responsible for the operation and include metadata specific to the type of operation.

As a user, you can only see your own audit logs unless you are an admin.

Audit Logs can be filtered by Date, Username, Action (Create, Update, Delete, Execute), and specific Operation.

## Retention Policy

The retention policy for audit logs varies depending on your team's [plan](/pricing):

- Community plan: Audit logs are redacted.
- Team plan (cloud): Audit logs are retained for 7 days.
- Enterprise plan (cloud): Audit logs are retained for 60 days.
- Enterprise plan (cloud): Audit logs are stored in Postgres and also emitted as logs, which are stored in the cloud for a year with the possibility of extending the retention period.

## Configure Retention Period

On [Enterprise Edition](/pricing), you can set a custom retention period for the audit logs. The retention period can be configured in the instance settings, in the "Core" tab.

## Viewing Jobs metadata from the Audit Logs

You can retrieve the job ID from the job and then access all the job metadata, including the job arguments by fetching the information from the job itself which is stored for as long as the configured retention period.

## Backing Up Audit Logs

To back up the audit logs, simply backup the Postgres database or store the logs in a cold archive. In the cloud environment, we employ both methods for backup.
