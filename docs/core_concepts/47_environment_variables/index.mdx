# Environment variables

Environment variables are used to configure the behavior of scripts and services, allowing for dynamic and flexible execution across different environments.

You can retrieve environment variables from a script with the `Contextual` tab on the [Variable](../2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx) page.

You can use them in a Script by clicking on "+Context Var":

## Contextual variables

Contextual variables are environment variables automatically set by Windmill. This is how the Deno and Python clients get their implicit
credentials to interact with the platform.

| WM_EMAIL | demo@windmill.dev | Email of the user that executed the current script |
| WM_USERNAME | ruben | Username of the user that executed the current script |
| WM_BASE_URL | https://app.windmill.dev/ | base url of this instance |

| WM_ROOT_FLOW_JOB_ID | 017e0ad5-f499-73b6-5488-92a61c5196dd | Job id of the root flow if the job is a flow step |
| WM_FLOW_PATH | u/user/flow_path | Path of the encapsulating flow if the job is a flow step |

### Custom contextual variables

From Variables tab, [admins](../16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx) can create custom contextual variables that will act as env variables for all jobs within a workspace.

We still recommend using [user-defined variables](../2_variables_and_secrets/index.mdx#user-defined-variables) but in some cases (e.g. your imports depend on env variables), this might be a good escape hatch.

## Custom environment variables

In a self-hosted environment, Windmill allows you to set custom environment variables for your scripts. This feature is useful when a script needs an environment variable prior to the main function executing itself. For instance, some libraries in Go do some setup in the 'init' function that depends on environment variables.

To add a custom environment variable to a script in Windmill, you should follow this format: `<KEY>=<VALUE>`. Where `<KEY>` is the name of the environment variable and `<VALUE>` is the corresponding value of the environment variable.

		description="In a self-hosted environment, Windmill allows you to set custom environment variables for your scripts."
		href="/docs/script_editor/custom_environment_variables"
	/>
</div>

## Environment variables passed to jobs

From a [worker group](../9_worker_groups/index.mdx), you can add static and dynamic environment variables that will be [passed to jobs](../9_worker_groups/index.mdx#environment-variables-passed-to-jobs) handled by this worker group. Dynamic environment variable values will be loaded from the worker host environment variables while static environment variables will be set directly from their values below.
