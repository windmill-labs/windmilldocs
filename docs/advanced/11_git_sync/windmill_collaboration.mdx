# Collaborating on Windmill

In windmill there are multiple ways to collaborate

## Workspace forks

The easiest and main way of collaborating on windmill is through the use of workspace forks. This feature lets users branch off of a workspace and have an exact copy where they can create new items or make changes, test them, and deploy them to the main workspace once it's all working.

## Git sync

Git sync is a feature that replicates the state of a workspace into a git repository. When properly set-up, changes made to the repository are immediately reflected in the workspace, and vice-versa. This enables local development as well as development in the Web IDE to be tracked and managed by git, and any git-based workflow is possible.


### Git sync + Workspace forks

Workspace forks unlock their full potential when git sync is enabled. When a fork is created, a branch with a corresponding name is created, and changes are tracked there.

### Example: feature development workflow

1. **Create fork**: The user forks the `main` workspace into a fork named `wm-fork-new-feature`
2. **Develop**: User makes changes in the forked workspace -> The changes are reflected in the branch `wm-fork/main/new-feature` of the repo
3. **Create PR**: A PR is automatically created by the CI from `wm-fork/main/new-feature` -> `main`
4. **Review & merge**: Team reviews changes before merging to main branch
5. **Sync back changes**: Changes are automatically synced to the main workspace as soon as the PR is merged.

## Advanced setup: Cross-instance deployment (promotion)

When you have workspaces in different instances, for example in a setup with a staging instance and a prod instance, you might want to deploy changes from one workspace to the other. One way to do this is through a cross-instance promotion: when changes are made in the first "staging" workspace, a branch with a name corresponding to the item is created in the second workspace's repo. A PR is automatically created through the CI/CD. Changes are reviewed, and once the PR is merged the changes are reflected in the "production" workspace.

**Requirements**:
- Git sync should be setup on both workspaces, so that they're both syncing changes with their respective repositories.
