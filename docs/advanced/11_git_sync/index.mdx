# Git sync

From the workspace settings, you can set a [git_repository](../../integrations/git_repository.mdx) resource on which the workspace will automatically commit and push scripts, flows and apps to the repository on each [deploy](../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx).

You can use this feature to [Deploy to prod using a git workflow](#git-sync---item-mode-deploy-to-prod-using-a-git-workflow).

This video shows how to set up a Git repository for a workspace (Git sync - workspace mode).

## Git sync - Workspace mode

All scripts, flows and apps located in the workspace will be pushed to the Git repository. You can filter Git sync on [path](../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx#path) so that only the scripts, flows and apps with a matching path will be pushed to the Git repository. By default, everything in [folders](../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx) will be synced (with rule `f/**`).

On each [deployment](../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx#deployed-version), only the updated script/flow/app will be pushed to the remote Git repository.

This feature is [Cloud & Enterprise Self-Hosted](/pricing) only.

Note that you can explicitly exclude (or include) specific files or folders to be taken into account with a [`wmill.yaml` file](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-sync-example/blob/main/wmill.yaml).

### Pull workspace locally

For the Git repo to be representative of the entire workspace, it is recommended to set it up using the [Windmill CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx) before turning this option on.

Use [Windmill CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx) to pull the workspace locally:

```bash
wmill sync pull
```

![Pull workpsace](./pull_workspace.png 'Pull workspace')

### Push workspace to GitHub

Create a Git repository (in the example, on GitHub).

Run the following commands from the git repo folder to push the initial workspace content to the remote:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
git push -u origin main
```

You now have your Windmill workspace on a GitHub repository. See the following section for an automated sync.

### Setup in Windmill & GitHub token

In Windmill, create a [git_repository](https://hub.windmill.dev/resource_types/135/git_repository) resource pointing to the GitHub repository and containing a [token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (with Read-and-write on "Contents"). You URL should be `https://[USERNAME]:[TOKEN]@github.com/[ORG|USER]/[REPO_NAME].git`.

Add this resource to the workspace settings, in "Git sync" tab and `Save Git sync settings`.

![Git sync Setup](./git_sync_setup.png 'Git sync Setup')

And that's it! Now, all scripts, flows apps, resources, variables, schedules and resource types located in the workspace and `f/` [folders](../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx) will be pushed to the Git repository.

You can filter on type if you don't want some items (e.g. variables) to be pushed to the Git repository.

Additionally, you can filter on [path](../../core_concepts/16_roles_and_permissions/index.mdx#path), meaning only scripts, flows and apps with their path matching one of those filters will be synced to the Git repositories below. The filters allow '*'' and '**' characters, with '*'' matching any character allowed in paths until the next slash (/) and '**' matching anything including slashes. By default everything in [folders](../../core_concepts/8_groups_and_folders/index.mdx) will be synced.

#### Signing commits with GPG
If your repo requires signed commits, you can set up GPG on your Windmill instance.

1. Generate a GPG key pair:
```
gpg --full-generate-key
```

2. Add the key to your GithHub account:
```
gpg --armor --export <key_id>
```
Go to your GitHub account settings => "SSH and GPG keys" and add the GPG public key.

3. Add the private key to your Windmill instance:
```
gpg --armor --export-keys <key_id>
```

In the Windmill workspace "Git Sync" settings, edit the "GPG key" field with the GPG private key. Use the email address associated with the key and set the passphrase if you added one.

![GPG key](./add_gpg_key.png 'GPG key')

:::caution Key ID and Email

Make sure to double check that the email address associated with the key is the same as the one you use to commit to the repo. Furthermore, double check that the key id is the same as the one you see in the "GPG key" field on your GitHub account.
<br />
All commits will now be signed and commited as the user matching the email address associated with the key.

### Azure DevOps with Service Principal setup
In Microsoft Entra ID, create an application and a secret (also known as Service Principal - an identity used by applications to access Azure resources). 
Create an `azure` resource on your Windmill instance with the application's `client_id`, `client_secret` and `tenant_id`.
On Azure DevOps, add the application to the DevOps organization with the appropriate permissions.
In Git sync settings of your Windmill instance, define a new repository with URL:

```
https://AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN(<path_to_the_azure_resource>)@dev.azure.com/<organization>/<project>/_git/<repository>
```

## Git sync - Item mode: Deploy to prod using a git workflow

This feature can be used alongside GiHub Actions to adopt a robust development process for your Windmill scripts, flows and apps,
with for example a Staging Workspace making automatically PRs on a repo that pushes to a Prod workspace upon merge.
