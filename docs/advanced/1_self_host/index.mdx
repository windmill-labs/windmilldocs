# Self Host Windmill

Self-host Windmill on your own infrastructure.

For small setups, use [Docker](#docker) and Docker Compose on a single instance.
For larger and production use-cases, use our [Helm chart](#helm-chart) to deploy on Kubernetes.

![Self-hosted Windmill](./self_hosted_windmill.png 'Self-hosted Windmill')

> Example of self-hosted Windmill on [localhost](#docker).

<br />

Windmill itself just requires 3 elements:

- A Postgres database, which contains the entire state of Windmill, including the job queue.
- The Windmill container run in server mode (and replicated for high availability). It serves both the frontend and the API. It needs to connect to the database and is what is exposed publicly to serve the frontend. It does not need to communicate to the workers directly.
- The Windmill container run in worker mode (and replicated to handle more job throughput). It needs to connect to the database and does not communicate to the servers.

There are 3 optional parts:

- Windmill LSP to provide intellisense on the [Monaco web Editor](../../code_editor/index.mdx).
- Windmill [Multiplayer](../../core_concepts/7_multiplayer/index.md) ([Cloud & Enterprise Selfhosted only](/pricing)) to provide real time collaboration.
- A reverse proxy (caddy in our [Docker compose](#docker)) to the Windmill server, LSP and multiplayer in order to expose a single port to the outside world.

The docker-compose [below](#docker) use the 6 parts and we recommend doing TLS termination outside of the provided caddy.

## Cloud provider-specific guides

For instances with specific cloud providers requirements:

- [AWS, GCP, Azure](#aws-gcp-azure-neon)
- [Fly.io](#flyio)
- [Hetzner, Fargate, Digital Ocean, Linode, Scaleway, Vultr, OVH, ...](#hetzner-fargate-digital-ocean-linode-scaleway-vultr-ovh-)

If you have no specific requirements, see [Docker](#docker).

### AWS, GCP, Azure, Neon

We recommend using the [Helm chart](#helm-chart) to deploy on managed [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). But for simplified setup, simply use the docker-compose (see [below](#docker)) on a single large instance and use a high number of replicas for the worker service.

The rule of thumb is 1 worker per 1vCPU and 1/2GB of RAM. Cloud providers have managed load balancer services (ELB, GCLB, ALB) and managed database (RDS, Cloud SQL, Aurora, Postgres on Azure). We recommend disabling the db service in the docker-compose and using an external database by setting according the `DATABASE_URL` in the [.env][windmill-env] file handling environment variables.

Windmill is compatible with [AWS Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/), [GCP Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us) and [Neon](https://neon.tech/) serverless database.

Use the managed load balancer to point to your instance on the port you have chosen to expose in the caddy section of the docker-compose (by default 80). We recommend doing TLS termination and associating your domain on your managed load balancer. Once the domain name is chosen, set BASE_URL accordingly in `.env`. That is it for a minimal setup. Read about [Worker groups](../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx) to configure more finely your workers on more nodes and with different resources. Once done, be sure to setup [SSO login](../../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx) with Azure AD, Google Workspace or Github if relevant.

:::tip AWS ECS

To be able to use the AWS APIs within Windmill on ECS containers, just whitelist the following environment variables in .env:
`WHITELIST_ENVS = "AWS_EXECUTION_ENV,AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI,AWS_DEFAULT_REGION,AWS_REGION"`

## Docker

### Setup Windmill on localhost

Self-host Windmill in less than a minute:

	allowFullScreen
	className="border-2 rounded-xl object-cover w-full dark:border-gray-800"
></iframe>

<br />

Using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), Windmill can be deployed using 3 files:
([`docker-compose.yml`][windmill-docker-compose], [`Caddyfile`][windmill-caddyfile]) and a [.env][windmill-env] in a single command.

[Caddy][caddy] is the reverse proxy that will redirect traffic to both Windmill (port 8000) and the LSP (the monaco assistant) service (port 3001) and multiplayer service (port 3002).
Postgres holds the entire state of Windmill, the rest is fully stateless, Windmill-LSP provides editor intellisense.

Make sure Docker is started:

- Mac: `open /Applications/Docker.app`
- Windows: `start docker`
- Linux: `sudo systemctl start docker`

and type the following commands:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile -o Caddyfile
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/.env -o .env

docker compose up -d
```

Go to [http://localhost](http://localhost) et voil√†!

Even if you setup oauth, login as `admin@windmill.dev` / `changeme` to setup the instance & accounts and give yourself super-admin privileges. Have them pre-filled at [http://localhost/user/login?email=admin@windmill.dev&password=changeme](http://localhost/user/login?email=admin@windmill.dev&password=changeme).

From there, you can follow the setup app to replace the superadmin account and schedule a sync of resources (by default, everyday).

### Use an external database

For more production use-cases, we recommend using the [Helm-chart](#helm-chart). However, the docker-compose on a big instance is sufficient for many use-cases.

To setup an external database, you need to set DATABASE_URL in the .env file to point your external database. You should also set the number of db replicas to 0.

:::tip

In setups where you do not have access to the PG superuser (Azure PostgreSQL, GCP Postgresql, etc), you will need to set the initial role manually. You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/init-db-as-superuser.sql -o init-db-as-superuser.sql
psql <DATABASE_URL> -f init-db-as-superuser.sql
```

Make sure that the user used in the DATABASE_URL passed to windmill has the role `windmill_admin` and `windmill_user`:

```sql
GRANT windmill_admin TO <user used in database_url>;
GRANT windmill_user TO <user used in database_url>;
```

If you cannot use BYPASSRLS (for instance on Azure PostgreSQL), on EE, pass `MIGRATION_NO_BYPASSRLS=true` to your servers, otherwise see this [workaround](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/issues/2345#issuecomment-1739777068)
:::

### Set number of replicas accordingly in docker-compose

In the docker-compose, set the number of windmill_worker and windmill_worker_native replicas to your needs.

### Enterprise Edition

To use the [enterprise edition](/pricing), you need pass the license key in the instance settings (Superadmin settings -> Instance settings).

You can then set the number of replicas of the multiplayer container to 1 in the docker-compose.

You will be provided a license key when you purchase the enterprise edition. Contact us at contact@windmill.dev to get a trial license key. Pricing is at [https://windmill.dev/pricing](https://windmill.dev/pricing). You will benefit from support, SLA and all the [additional features](/pricing) of the enterprise edition.

### Configuring Domain and Reverse Proxy

To deploy Windmill to the `windmill.example.com` domain, make sure to set "Base Url" correctly in the Instance Settings (Superadmin Settings -> Instance Settings -> Base Url)

You can use any reverse proxy as long as they behave mostly like the default provided following caddy configuration:

```
:80 {
        bind {$ADDRESS}
        reverse_proxy /ws/* http://lsp:3001
        reverse_proxy /* http://windmill_server:8000
}
```

The default docker-compose file exposes the caddy reverse-proxy on port 80 above, configured by the [caddyfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/Caddyfile) curled above. Configure both the caddyfile and the docker-compose file to fit your needs. The documentation for caddy is available [here](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile).

#### Use provided Caddy to serve https

For simplicity, we recommend using an external reverse proxy such as Cloudfront or Cloudflare and point to your instance on the port you have chosen (by default, :80).

However, Caddy also supports HTTPS natively via its [tls](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls) directive. Multiple options are available. Caddy can obtain certificates automatically using the ACME protocol, a provided CA file, or even a custom HTTP endpoint. The simplest is to provide your own certifcate and key files. You can do so by mounting an additional volume containing those two files to the Caddy container and adding a `tls /path/to/cert.pem /path/to/key.pem` directive to the Caddy file. Make sure to expose the port `:443` instead of `:80` and Caddy will take care of the rest.

For all the above, see the commented lines in the caddy section of the docker-compose.

#### Traefik configuration

<details>
  <summary>Here is a template of a docker-compose to expose Windmill to Traefik. Make sure to replace the `traefik` network with whatever network you have it running on. Code below:</summary>

You may need to adapt this depending on if you have Traefik running or on your configuration. This also assumes you have a `letsencryptresolver` or change the name to your certificate resolver if you want to use the `websecure` entrypoint.

</details>

### Deployment

Once you have setup your environment for deployment, you can run the following
command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

That's it! Head over to your domain and you should be greeted with the login
screen.

In practice, you want to run the Docker containers in the background so they don't shut down when you disconnect. Do this with the `--detach` or `-d` parameter as follows:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

:::tip

Default e-mail is `admin@windmill.dev` and the password is `changeme`.

:::

### Update

To update to a newer version of Windmill, all you have to do is run:

```bash
docker compose stop windmill_worker
docker compose pull windmill_server
docker compose up -d
```

Database volume is persistent, so updating the database image is safe too. Windmill provides graceful exit for jobs in workers so it will not interrupt current jobs unless they are longer than docker stop hard kill timeout (30 seconds).

It is sufficient to run `docker compose up -d` again if your Docker is already running detached, since it will pull the latest `:main` version and restart the containers.
NOTE: The previous images are not removed automatically, you should also run `docker builder prune` to clear old versions.

### Reset your instance

Windmill stores all of its state in PostgreSQL and it is enough to reset the database to reset the instance.
Hence, in the setup above, to reset your Windmill instance, it is enough to reset the PostgreSQL volumes. Run:

```
docker compose down --volumes
docker volume rm -f windmill_db_data
```

and then `docker compose up -d`.

## Helm Chart

We also provide a convenient [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
for Kubernetes-based self-hosted set-up.

Detailed instructions can be found in the [README][helm-readme] file in the
[official repository][helm] of the chart.

:::tip

If you're familiar with Helm and want to jump right in, you can deploy quickly
with the snippet below.

```bash
# add the Windmill helm repo
helm repo add windmill https://windmill-labs.github.io/windmill-helm-charts/
# install chart with default values
helm install windmill-chart windmill/windmill  \
      --namespace=windmill             \
      --create-namespace
```

Detailed instructions in the official [repository][helm].

:::

### Enterprise deployment with Helm

The [Enterprise edition](/pricing) of Windmill uses different base images and supports
additional features.

See the [Helm Chart repository README][helm] for more details.

To unlock EE, set in your values.yaml:

```
enterprise:
	enable: true
```

You will want to disable the postgresql provided with the helm chart and set the database_url to your own managed postgresql.

For high-scale deployments (> 20 workers), we recommend using the [global S3 cache](../../misc/13_s3_cache/index.md). You will need an object storage compatible with the s3 protocol.

## Run Windmill without using a Postgres superuser

Create the database with your non-super user as owner:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE windmill OWNER nonsuperuser
```

As a superuser, create the windmill_user and windmill_admin roles with the
proper privileges, using:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/init-db-as-superuser.sql -o init-db-as-superuser.sql
psql <DATABASE_URL> -f init-db-as-superuser.sql
```

where `init-db-as-superuser.sql` is
[this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windmill-labs/windmill/main/init-db-as-superuser.sql).

Then finally, run the following commands:

```sql
GRANT windmill_admin TO nonsuperuser;
GRANT windmill_user TO nonsuperuser;
```

**NOTE: Make sure the roles `windmill_admin` and `windmill_user` have access to the database and the schema:**

You can ensure this by running the following commands as superuser while inside the database. Replace the schema
name `public` with your schema, in case you use a different one:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO windmill_admin;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO windmill_user;
```

## Self-Hosted Instance Set-up

### Complete New Windmill Set-Up

In the Admin Workspace execute the New User Setup App. This will import the default [resources types](../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) from [WindmillHub](https://hub.windmill.dev/) and update the default user credentials

### Authentication and user management

We recommend setting up [SSO with OAuth](../../misc/2_setup_oauth/index.mdx) if you want to avoid adding users manually.

If not using OAuth SSO, we recommend setting up SMTP to send invites and email to manually added users.

<details>
  <summary>Set-up SMTP from the `.env` file (depreciated) </summary>

The relevant environment variables are:

```
SMTP_FROM=windmill@domain.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=email@domain.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=app_password
```

If you used the [Setup Windmill on localhost](#setup-windmill-on-localhost) method, open the `.env` file in any text editor. You can use `nano`, `vim`, or any other editor you're comfortable with.

```bash
nano .env
```

Append the following to the end of your `.env` file:

```
SMTP_FROM=windmill@domain.com
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your_email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

Make sure to replace `your_email@gmail.com` with your actual Gmail email address and `your_app_password` with the app password you've generated from Gmail.

{' '}

<br />

> **Note**: If you're using Gmail, you'll need to [generate an App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to use as `SMTP_PASSWORD`. This is a unique password that Gmail provides for apps and services that want to connect to your account.

<br />

Save and Close the File:

- If using `nano`, press `CTRL + O` to save and then `CTRL + X` to exit.
- If using `vim`, press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and press `Enter`.

Restart your Windmill application:

- Since you've made changes to the `.env` file, you'll need to restart your Windmill application for the changes to take effect.

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

Now, your Windmill instance should use the SMTP settings you've provided to send invites and email to manually added users. Make sure the SMTP details you've provided are correct and that the Gmail account you're using has allowed less secure apps or generated an App Password.

</details>

#### Set up SMTP from the UI

<br />

From your self-hosted instance, click on your username and pick "Superadmin settings" and "SMTP" tab.

![Superadmin settings](./superadmin_settings.png 'Superadmin settings')

Fill your SMTP details.

**Note**: If you're using Gmail, you'll need to [generate an App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) to use as `SMTP_PASSWORD`. This is a unique password that Gmail provides for apps and services that want to connect to your account.

You'll be offered to "Test SMTP settings" & send a blank e-mail to a given address.

What distinguishes the admin workspace from other workspaces is that its [resource types](../../core_concepts/3_resources_and_types/index.mdx) are shared with all workspaces.

If you skipped the instance setup or need to sync resource types, you can go to the admins workspace and run the _Synchronize Hub Resource types with instance_ script, or [schedule](../../core_concepts/1_scheduling/index.mdx) it.

For more advanced setups, see [Helm Chart](#helm-chart).
