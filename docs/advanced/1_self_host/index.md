# Self Host Windmill

[Windmill's GitHub repository][windmill-gh] contains all the necessary files to
run Windmill locally, or to self-host it.

We encourage Docker-based deployments, and provide a `docker-compose` file to
help you get started.

## Docker

:::tip

Simplified instruction for docker compose in the
[README](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill#how-to-self-host).

:::

:::warning

Use `docker compose` and not `docker-compose`.

:::

:::info

When talking about the `compose`, or `caddyfile`, we explicitly refer to the
ones on [Windmill's GitHub repository][windmill-gh].

:::

Using Docker and Caddy, Windmill can be deployed using two files,
([`docker-compose.yml`][windmill-docker-compose] and
[`Caddyfile`][windmill-caddyfile]) and in a single command.

[Caddy][caddy] takes care of managing the TLS certificate and the reverse proxy,
Postgres of storage, Windmill-LSP provides editor intellisense. All managed by
one [`docker-compose.yml`][windmill-docker-compose] file.

### Configuration

Let's assume you wish to deploy Windmill to the `windmill.example.com` domain.
This information only needs to be propagated to the `docker-compose.yml` file,
using the `WM_BASE_URL` environment variable.

Create/edit the `.env` file at the root of the project and set your desired
address:

```bash
# .env
DB_PASSWORD=supersecret
WM_BASE_URL=http://windmill.example.com
CADDY_REVERSE_PROXY=http://windmill.example.com
```

Setting the `WM_BASE_URL` configures Windmill to use it as its base url. The reverse proxy is also configured at the same domain. You can use any reverse proxy as long as they behave mostly like the following caddy configuration:

```
http://{$BASE_URL} {
        bind {$ADDRESS}
        reverse_proxy /ws/* http://lsp:3001
        reverse_proxy /* http://windmill_server:8000
}
```

### Deployment

Once you have setup your environment for deployment, you can run the following
command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

That's it! Head over to your domain and you should be greeted with the login
screen.

:::tip

Default e-mail is `admin@windmill.dev` and the password is `changeme`.

:::

### Update

To update to a newer version of Windmill, all you have to do is run:

```bash
docker compose pull
```

Or in case you wish to update only the Windmill image, run:

```bash
docker compose pull windmill
```

Database volume is persistent, so updating the database image is safe too.

## Helm Chart

We also provide a convenient [Helm Chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
for Kubernetes based self-hosted set-up.

Detailed instructions can be found in the [README][helm-readme] file in the
[official repository][helm] of the chart.

:::tip

If you're familiar with Helm and want to jump right in, you can deploy quickly
with the snippet below.

```bash
# add the Windmill helm repo
helm repo add windmill https://windmill-labs.github.io/windmill-helm-charts/
# install chart with default values
helm install windmill-chart windmill/windmill  \
      --namespace=windmill             \
      --create-namespace
```

Detailed instructions in the official [repository][helm].

:::

### Enterprise deployment with Helm

The Enterprise edition of Windmill uses different base images and supports
additional features. One important feature is better caching for depencies in a
super cache supported by S3.

You need:

- an Enterprise license key
- an AWS account and S3 bucket
- AWS credentials or IAM roles prepared for access from the Windmill worker pods.
  <br/>

See the [Helm Chart repository README][helm] [repository][helm] for more details. The exact setup
for S3 access will vary according to your environment.

## Compile from source

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder ([source][windmill-gh-frontend]) and run:
   ```bash
   npm run install
   npm run generate-backend-client
   npm run build
   ```
2. Install the [LLD Linker](https://lld.llvm.org/).
3. Go to `backend` folder ([source][windmill-gh-backend]) and run:
   ```bash
   SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo build --release
   ```
4. The Windmill binary will be at `target/release/windmill`

You can run it with the following command:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url> ./windmill
```

Windmill binary will make the assumption that NsJail is in `PATH`, Python3 is
available at `/usr/local/bin/python3` and Deno at `/usr/bin/deno`. It will also
assume that you are connected to PostgreSQL using a superuser. If you cannot use
a superuser, see the following section.

## Run Windmill without using a Postgres superuser

Create the database with your non-super user as owner:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE windmill OWNER nonsuperuser
```

As a superuser, create the windmill_user and windmill_admin roles with the
proper privileges, using:

```bash
psql <DATABASE_URL> -f init-db-as-superuser.sql
```

where `init-db-as-superuser.sql` is
[this file](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/init-db-as-superuser.sql).

Then finally, run the following commands:

```sql
GRANT windmill_admin TO nonsuperuser;
GRANT windmill_user TO nonsuperuser;
```
