# Sync

Synchronizing folders & git repositories to a Windmill instance is made easy
using the wmill CLI. Syncing operations are behind the `wmill sync` subcommand.

Having a Windmill instance synchronized to folders & git repositories allows for
local development through the [VS Code extension](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx).

Syncing is done using `wmill sync pull` & `wmill sync push`.

Syncing is a one-off operation with no state maintained. It will override any item that is within the scope: remove those that are in the target and not in the source, and it will create new items that are in source but not in target.
It is a _dangerous_ operation, that we recommend doing on a version-controlled folder to be able to revert any undesired changes made by mistake if necessary. It will however, show you the list of changes and ask you for confirmation before applying them.

To specify the scopes of files, you should modify the includes and excludes (array of path matchers) part of the `wmill.yaml` file generated with `wmill init`. We recommend looking at all the settings of the `wmill.yaml` file to understand the different options available.
Those are the default ones:

```
defaultTs: bun
includes:
  - f/**
excludes: []
codebases: []
skipVariables: true
skipResources: true
skipResourceTypes: true
skipSecrets: true
includeSchedules: false
includeTriggers: false
```

See more details in [wmill.yaml](#wmillyaml).

Note that here, the variables, resources, secrets, schedules, and triggers are all skipped by default. You can change that by setting the corresponding options.

When pulling, the source is the remote workspace and the target is the local folder, and when pushing, the source is the local folder and the target is the remote workspace.

To add a remote workspace, use `wmill workspace add`, and to switch workspace after having added multiple, use `wmill workspace switch <source_workspace_id>`. The workspaces can be on completely different instances.

```bash
wmill workspace switch <source_workspace_id>
wmill sync pull
wmill workspace switch <target_workspace_id>
wmill sync push
```

It can be used for bi-directional sync using Windmill EE and [Git sync](../11_git_sync/index.mdx).

### Pulling

`wmill sync pull` will simply pull all files from the currently
[selected workspace](./workspace-management.md#selected-workspace) and store
them in the current folder. Overwrites will not prompt the user. Make sure you
are in the correct folder or you may loose data.

### Pushing

`wmill sync push` will simply push all local files to the currently
[selected workspace](./workspace-management.md#selected-workspace), creating or
updating the remote equivalents.

## Pull API

The `wmill sync pull` command is used to pull remote changes and apply them locally. It synchronizes the local workspace with the remote workspace by downloading any remote changes and updating the corresponding local files.

```bash
wmill sync pull [options]
```

## Push API

The `wmill sync push` command is used to push local changes and apply them remotely. It synchronizes the remote workspace with the local workspace by uploading any local changes and updating the corresponding remote files.

```bash
wmill sync push [options]
```

## wmill.yaml

Note that you can set the default TypeScript language and explicitly exclude (or include) specific files or folders to be taken into account with a [`wmill.yaml` file](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill-sync-example/blob/main/wmill.yaml).

```yaml
includes: ['f/**'] # uses "*" or uncomment this line to include everything. Note that wmill will only consider files with valid path (u/ or f/, with the right extension)
excludes: [] # excludes patterns here

defaultTs: 'deno' # bun is the default, set it to deno if you primarily use deno to avoid needing the .deno.ts extension
```

All sync options for your workspace can be found on this [file](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/cli/conf.ts#L3):

```ts
export interface SyncOptions {
	raw?: boolean;
	yes?: boolean;
	skipPull?: boolean;
	failConflicts?: boolean;
	plainSecrets?: boolean;
	json?: boolean;
	skipVariables?: boolean;
	skipResources?: boolean;
	skipResourceTypes?: boolean;
	skipSecrets?: boolean;
	includeSchedules?: boolean;
	includeUsers?: boolean;
	includeGroups?: boolean;
	includeSettings?: boolean;
	message?: string;
	includes?: string[];
	extraIncludes?: string[];
	excludes?: string[];
	defaultTs?: 'bun' | 'deno';
	codebases?: Codebase[];
}
```

## Example repo for syncing with Windmill in git

## Cloning an instance

Instances can be cloned with Windmill CLI. This is useful for instance migration or for setting up a new (prod) instance with the same configuration as an existing one.

### Pulling an instance

To pull instance users, groups, settings and configs (=worker groups+SMTP) from the instance use `wmill instance pull`.

You can skip any of those using `--skip-XXX`.

You can also pull all workspaces at the same time by adding the `--include-workspaces` option. It will setup for each a local workspace (including a folder in the current directory) with a prefix specific to the instance (based on the name you've given to the instance).

### Pushing an instance

To push to an instance use `wmill instance push`. It takes the same options as pulling an instance.

When using `--include-workspaces`, you will also have to select the instance prefix of the local workspaces you want to push (make sure you're in its parent folder).

During the push process, you will be prompted to decide whether to [re-encrypt](./workspace-management.md#managing-encryption-keys) the secrets of the workspace on the remote instance. In the case of instance migration, it is recommended to select "no" as the secrets are already encrypted with the correct key.
