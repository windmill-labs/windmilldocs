# Branch-specific items

Branch-specific items allow you to have different versions of resources and variables per Git branch. This enables teams to maintain environment-specific configurations (dev/staging/prod) that automatically sync to the correct branch-namespaced files locally while maintaining clean base paths in the Windmill workspace.

## How branch-specific items work

When a file is marked as branch-specific through pattern matching in your `wmill.yaml` configuration, the CLI automatically transforms the file path based on the current Git branch:

- **Local files**: Use branch-suffixed names (e.g., `database.main.resource.yaml`)
- **Windmill workspace**: Uses clean base paths (e.g., `database.resource.yaml`)

This allows different branches to have different configurations for the same logical resource while keeping the workspace paths clean.

## Configuration

Branch-specific items are configured using two complementary patterns in your `wmill.yaml`:

### Branch-specific items

Items that should only be branch-specific for certain branches:

```yaml
gitBranches:
  main:
    specificItems:
      variables:
        - "u/alex/prod_*"
      resources:
        - "u/alex/production/**"

  dev:
    specificItems:
      variables:
        - "u/alex/dev_*"
      resources:
        - "u/alex/development/**"
```

### Common specific items

Items that should be branch-specific across all branches:

```yaml
gitBranches:
  commonSpecificItems:
    variables:
      - "u/alex/database_*"
      - "f/config/**"
    resources:
      - "u/alex/api_keys/**"
      - "f/environments/**"
```

### Pattern matching

Patterns support standard glob syntax:

- `*` matches any characters within a path segment
- `**` matches any characters across path segments
- `u/alex/database_*` matches `u/alex/database_config`, `u/alex/database_url`, etc.
- `f/environments/**` matches all files under `f/environments/` recursively

## Branch name safety

Branch names containing certain characters are automatically sanitized for filesystem safety:

- **Unsafe characters**: `/ \ : * ? " < > | .`
- **Replacement**: All unsafe characters are replaced with `_`
- **Warning**: The CLI shows a clear warning when sanitization occurs

```bash
Warning: Branch name "feature/api-v2.1" contains filesystem-unsafe characters (/ \ : * ? " < > | .)
and was sanitized to "feature_api-v2_1". This may cause collisions with other similarly named branches.
```

## File path transformation

### Transform logic

When syncing branch-specific items, paths are transformed as follows:

**Pull operation** (Windmill workspace → local):
- Windmill workspace: `u/alex/database.resource.yaml`
- Local: `u/alex/database.main.resource.yaml` (on main branch)

**Push operation** (local → Windmill workspace):
- Local: `u/alex/database.dev.resource.yaml` (on dev branch)
- Windmill workspace: `u/alex/database.resource.yaml`

### Supported file types

Only these file types support branch-specific transformation:

- **Variables**: `*.variable.yaml`
- **Resources**: `*.resource.yaml`

## Usage examples

### Basic setup

1. **Initialize branch-specific configuration**:

```bash
# Create wmill.yaml with branch configuration
wmill init
```

2. **Configure patterns** in `wmill.yaml`:

```yaml
gitBranches:
  main:
    specificItems:
      resources:
        - "u/alex/config/**"
      variables:
        - "u/alex/env_*"
    overrides:
      skipSecrets: false

  dev:
    specificItems:
      resources:
        - "u/alex/config/**"
      variables:
        - "u/alex/env_*"
    overrides:
      skipSecrets: true
```

### Working with different environments

**On main branch**:
```bash
git checkout main
wmill sync pull
# Creates: u/alex/config/database.main.resource.yaml
# Creates: u/alex/env_api_key.main.variable.yaml
```

**On dev branch**:
```bash
git checkout dev
wmill sync pull
# Creates: u/alex/config/database.dev.resource.yaml
# Creates: u/alex/env_api_key.dev.variable.yaml
```

**Making changes**:
```bash
# Edit the dev-specific database config
vim u/alex/config/database.dev.resource.yaml

# Push changes - only affects dev workspace
wmill sync push
```

## Best practices

### Configuration patterns

- **Start broad**: Use `commonSpecificItems` for widely-used resources
- **Be specific**: Target exact paths rather than overly broad patterns
- **Group logically**: Organize patterns by team, environment, or function

### Team workflows

1. **Define patterns early**: Establish branch-specific patterns before team members start using them
2. **Document conventions**: Make clear which resources should be branch-specific
3. **Review warnings**: Pay attention to CLI warnings about unsafe characters
4. **Test locally**: Verify branch-specific behavior works correctly before CI/CD integration

## Troubleshooting

### Files not being detected as branch-specific

**Problem**: Files you expect to be branch-specific are not being transformed.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check patterns**: Ensure your glob patterns match the file paths exactly
2. **Verify file types**: Only `.variable.yaml` and `.resource.yaml` files are supported
3. **Pattern testing**: Use tools like [globtester.com](https://globtester.com) to test your patterns

### Files in wrong workspace

**Problem**: Branch-specific files are syncing to the wrong workspace.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check branch config**: Ensure your branch configuration is correct
2. **Verify current branch**: Make sure you're on the expected Git branch
3. **Configuration precedence**: Remember that CLI flags override branch settings

## Git sync integration

When [Git sync](../11_git_sync/index.mdx) is configured, branch-specific items work seamlessly with your Git repository setup. Git sync will automatically push changes to the correct branch-specific files based on the repository and branch configured in your `git_repository` resource.

**Example workflow**:
- **Production workspace**: Configured with `git_repository` pointing to `repoX` on `prod` branch
  - Changes to `database.resource.yaml` → pushes to `database.prod.resource.yaml` in repository
- **Development workspace**: Configured with `git_repository` pointing to `repoX` on `dev` branch  
  - Changes to `database.resource.yaml` → pushes to `database.dev.resource.yaml` in repository

This ensures that each workspace environment maintains its own branch-specific configurations while using the same logical resource names in the Windmill workspace.
