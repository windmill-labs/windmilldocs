# Command Line Interface (wmill)

The wmill CLI allows you to interact with Windmill instances right from your
terminal.

You can also use it for various automation tasks, including
[syncing](./syncing.md) folders &
[github-repositories](./syncing.md#stateful-sycing), or just running all you scripts and flows.

See [Installation](./installation.md) for getting started.
