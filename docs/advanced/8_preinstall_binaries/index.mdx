# Preinstall Binaries

Workers in Windmill can preinstall binaries. This allows them to execute these binaries in subprocesses or directly within bash. While some common binaries like npm, aws-cli, kubectl, and helm are already present in the standard images, you can add more by extending the base image of Windmill.

Below are the steps and examples to extend the base image:

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill:main
# or FROM ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill-ee:main for extending the enterprise edition

RUN apt-get update && apt install [...]

CMD ["windmill"]
```

## Example: Installing Puppeteer (via npm)

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill-ee:main

RUN apt update
RUN apt install npm -y
RUN mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
RUN curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/gpgkey/nodesource-repo.gpg.key |  gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg
RUN echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/nodesource.gpg] https://deb.nodesource.com/node_20.x nodistro main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nodesource.list
RUN apt-get update -y
RUN apt install nodejs libnss3-dev  libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libcups2-dev  libdrm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libxcomposite-dev libxdamage-dev libxrandr-dev\
  libgbm-dev libpango-1.0 libcairo-dev libasound-dev -y
RUN npm install -g puppeteer -y

CMD ["windmill"]
```

> Note: The example above uses the enterprise edition (`windmill-ee`) as the base.

## Example: Installing Playwright (via pip)

```dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/windmill-labs/windmill-ee:main

RUN pip install playwright
RUN playwright install
RUN playwright install-deps

CMD ["windmill"]
```

> Note: The example above uses the enterprise edition (`windmill-ee`) as the base.

## Examples with docker compose

All examples above can be used in your [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) by specifying the build context.

Replace:
```
  windmill_worker:
    image: ${WM_IMAGE}
```

With the following:
```
  windmill_worker:
    build:
      context: ./path/to/dockerfile
      args:
        WM_IMAGE: ${WM_IMAGE}
```

Note that you can pass environment variables from your `.env` file via the args above and use them in your `Dockerfile`:
```dockerfile
ARG WM_IMAGE
FROM ${WM_IMAGE}

[...]
```


## Init Scripts

Init scripts provide a method to pre-install binaries or set initial configurations without the need to modify the base image. This approach offers added convenience. Init Scripts are executed at the beginning when the worker starts, ensuring that any necessary binaries or configurations are set up before the worker undertakes any other job.

Any scripts are set from the [Worker Management UI](../../misc/11_worker_group_management_ui/index.mdx), at the worker group level. Any script content specified in `INIT_SCRIPT` will be executed at the beginning when each worker of the worker group starts.

When adjustments are made in the [Worker Management UI](../../misc/11_worker_group_management_ui/index.mdx), the workers will shut down and are expected to be restarted by their supervisor (Docker or k8s).
