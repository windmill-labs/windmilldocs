# Sync Workspace to Remote Git Repository

From the workspace settings, you can set a [git_repository](../../integrations/git_repository.mdx) resource on which the workspace will automatically commit and push scripts, flows and apps to the repository on each deploy.

:::info Private Folders

Script, flows and apps in the user private folders will be ignored 
All scripts, flows and apps located in the workspace will be pushed to the Git repository, except the ones that are saved in private user folders (i.e. where the path starts with `u/`, use those with `f/` instead).

:::

Every time a script is deployed, only the updated script will be pushed to the remote Git repository.

For the Git repo to be representative of the entire workspace, it is recommended to set it up using the [Windmill CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx) before turning this option on.

Run the following commands from the git repo folder to push the initial workspace content to the remote:

```bash

> wmill workspace add WORKSPACE_NAME WORKSPACE_ID WINDMILL_URL
> wmill sync pull --raw --skip-variables --skip-secrets --skip-resources
> git add -A git commit -m 'Initial commit'
> git push

```
