# Local Development

Windmill has [its own integrated development environment](../../code_editor/index.mdx), but you can also develop and run scripts locally.

Local development in Windmill (whether [self-hosted](../1_self_host/index.mdx) or on the cloud) has two distinct aspects:

1. **Editing scripts and flows**: This is done in [VS Code](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx) where Windmill has its own [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=windmill-labs.windmill). The extension allows for [UI pre-visualization](../../core_concepts/23_instant_preview/index.mdx), fetching resources, variables, scripts & flows, and testing them. However, these runs and executions are technically carried out from your remote instance.

2. **Run locally**. For iteration, integration with CI/CD and testing purposes you may need to [run a script locally](./run_locally.mdx) that also interacts with Windmill (for example, to retrieve resources). It will allow to integrate Windmill with any testing framework. To do this, you will need to fill out the context variables that would otherwise be filled out by the Windmill runtime for you.
