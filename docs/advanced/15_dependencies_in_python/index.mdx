# Dependencies in Python

In Windmill [standard mode](#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-imports-standard), dependencies in [Python](../../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx) are handled directly within their scripts without the need to manage separate dependency files.
From the import lines, Windmill automatically handles the resolution and caching of the script dependencies to ensure fast and consistent execution (this is standard mode).

There are however methods to have more control on your dependencies:
- Leveraging [standard mode](#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-imports-standard) on [web IDE](#web-ide) or [locally](#cli).
- Using [PEP-723 inline script metadata](#pep-723-inline-script-metadata) for standardized dependency specification.
- Overriding dependencies [providing a requirements.txt](#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-a-requirementstxt).

Moreover, there are other tricks, compatible with the methodologies mentioned above:
- [Sharing common logic with Relative Imports](#sharing-common-logic-with-relative-imports).
- [Pinning dependencies and requirements](#pinning-dependencies-and-requirements).
- [Private PyPI Repository](#private-pypi-repository).
- [Python runtime settings](#python-runtime-settings).

## Lockfile per script inferred from imports (Standard)

In Windmill, you can run scripts without having to [manage a requirements.txt](#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-a-requirementstxt) directly. This is achieved by automatically parsing the top-level imports and resolving the dependencies. For automatic dependency installation, Windmill will only consider these top-level imports.

In Python, the top-level imports are automatically parsed on saving of the script and a list of imports is generated. For automatic dependency installation, Windmill will only consider these top-level imports.

A dependency job is then spawned to associate that list of PyPI packages with a lockfile, which will lock
the versions. This ensures that the same version of a Python script is always
executed with the same versions of its dependencies. It also avoids the hassle
of having to maintain a separate requirements file.

We use a simple heuristics to infer the package name: the import root name must be the package name. We also maintain a list of exceptions.
You can make a PR to add your dependency to the list of exceptions [here](https://github.com/windmill-labs/windmill/blob/main/backend/parsers/windmill-parser-py-imports/src/mapping.rs).

### Web IDE

When a script is deployed through the Web IDE, Windmill generates a lockfile to ensure that the same [version of a script](../../core_concepts/34_versioning/index.mdx#script-versioning) is always executed with the same versions of its [dependencies](../6_imports/index.mdx). To generate a lockfile, it analyzes the imports, the imports can [use a version pin](#pinning-dependencies-and-requirements) or if no version is used, it uses the latest version. Windmill's [workers](../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx) cache dependencies to ensure fast performance without the need to pre-package dependencies - most jobs take under 100ms end-to-end.

At runtime, a deployed script always uses the same version of its dependencies.

At each [deployment](../../core_concepts/0_draft_and_deploy/index.mdx), the lockfile is automatically recomputed from the imports in the script and the imports used by the [relative imports](#sharing-common-logic-with-relative-imports). The computation of that lockfile is done by a dependency jobs that you can find in the [Runs](../../core_concepts/5_monitor_past_and_future_runs/index.mdx) page.

### CLI

On [local development](../4_local_development/index.mdx), each script gets:
- a content file (`script_path.py`, `script_path.ts`, `script_path.go`, etc.) that contains the code of the script,
- a metadata file (`script_path.yaml`) that contains the metadata of the script,
- a lockfile (`script_path.lock`) that contains the dependencies of the script.

You can get those 3 files for each script by pulling your workspace with command [`wmill sync pull`](../3_cli/sync.mdx).

Editing a script is as simple as editing its content. The code can be edited freely in your IDE, and there are possibilities to even run it locally if you have the correct development environment setup for the script language.

Using [wmill CLI](../3_cli/index.mdx) command [`wmill script generate-metadata`](../3_cli/script.md#re-generating-a-script-metadata-file), lockfiles can be generated and updated as files. The CLI asks the Windmill servers to run dependency job, using either the [requirements.txt (if present)](#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-a-requirementstxt) or asking Windmill to automatically resolve it from the script's code as input, and from the output of those jobs, create the lockfiles.
When a lockfile is present alongside a script at time of deployment by the CLI, no dependency job is run and the present lockfile is used instead.

## Lockfile per script inferred from a requirements.txt

Although Windmill can [automatically resolve imports](#lockfile-per-script-inferred-from-imports-standard). It is possible to override the dependencies by providing a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory as the script as you would do in a standard Python project, building and maintaining a requirements.txt to declare dependencies.

<br/>

When doing [`wmill script generate-metadata`](../3_cli/script.md#re-generating-a-script-metadata-file), if a requirements.txt is discovered, the closest one will be used as source-of-truth instead of being discovered from the imports in the script directly to generate the lockfile from the server.

You can write those requirements.txt manually or through a standard `pip install package_name`.

Several requirements.txt files can therefore coexist, each having authority over the scripts closest to it:

```
└── windmill_folder/
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── f/foo/
    │   ├── requirements.txt
    │   ├── script1.py
    │   ├── # script1.py will use the dependencies from windmill_folder/f/foo/requirements.txt
    │   └── /bar/
    │       ├── requirements.txt
    │       ├── script2.py
    │       └── # script2.py will use the dependencies from windmill_folder/f/foo/bar/requirements.txt
    └── f/baz/
        ├── script3.py
        └── # script3.py will use the dependencies from windmill_folder/requirements.txt
```

The Windmill [VS Code extension](../../cli_local_dev/1_vscode-extension/index.mdx) has a toggle "Infer lockfile" / "Use current lockfile".

With this toggle, you can choose to use the metadata lockfile (derived from requirements.txt after `wmill script generate-metadata`) instead of inferring them directly from the script.

## Other

Other tricks can be used: [Sharing common logic with relative imports](#sharing-common-logic-with-relative-imports), [Pinning dependencies and requirements](#pinning-dependencies-and-requirements) and [Private PyPI Repository](#private-pypi-repository). All are compatible with the methods described above.

### Sharing common logic with relative imports

If you want to share common logic with Relative Imports, this can be done easily using [relative imports](../5_sharing_common_logic/index.mdx) in both Python and TypeScript.

It is possible to import directly from other Python scripts. One can simply
follow the path layout. For instance,
`import foo from f.<foldername>.script_name`. A more complete example below:

```python
# u/user/common_logic

def foo():
  print('Common logic!')
```

And in another Script:

```python
# u/user/custom_script

from u.user.common_logic import foo

def main():
  return foo()
```

It works with Scripts contained in folders, and for scripts contained in
user-spaces, e.g: `f.<foldername>.script_path` or `u.<username>.script_path`.

You can also do relative imports to the current script. For instance.

```python
# if common_logic is a script in the same folder or user-space
from .common_logic import foo
# otherwise if you need to access the folder 'folder'
from ..folder.common_logic import foo
```

Beware that you can only import scripts that you have view rights on at time of execution.

The folder layout is identical with the one that works with the CLI for syncing
scripts locally and on Windmill. See [Developing scripts locally](../4_local_development/index.mdx).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-4">
	<DocCard
		title="Sharing common logic"
		description="It is common to want to share common logic between your scripts. This can be done easily using relative imports in both Python and TypeScript."
		href="/docs/advanced/sharing_common_logic"
	/>
</div>

### Pinning dependencies and requirements
#### Requirements
If the imports are not properly analyzed, there exists an escape hatch to
override the inferred imports. One needs to head the Script with the `requirements` comment followed by dependencies.
The standard pip [requirement specifiers](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirement-specifiers/) are supported. Some examples:

```python
#requirements:
#dependency1[optional_module]
#dependency2>=0.40
#dependency3@git+https://github.com/myrepo/dependency3.git

import dependency1
import dependency2
import dependency3

def main(...):
  ...
```

#### Extra requirements

To add extra dependencies or pin the version of some dependencies

To combine both the inference of Windmill and being able to pin dependencies, use `extra_requirements`:

```python
#extra_requirements:
#dependency==0.4

import pandas
import dependency

def main(...):
  ...
```

#### Pin and Repin

It is possible to pin specific import to different version or even another dependency

```python
import pandas
import dependency # pin: dependency==0.4
import nested.modules # pin: nested-modules

def main(...):
  ...
```

If import was pinned once, whenever you use the same import again it will be pinned.

It is possible to have several pins to same import and all of them will be included.
However if you want to override all pins associated with an import you can use `repin`
```python
# content of f/foo/bar:
import dependency # pin: dependency==0.4 Hard lock on 0.4
...

# content of f/foo/baz:
import dependency # pin: dependency==1.0 Hard lock on 1.0
...

# content of f/foo/main:
import f.foo.bar
import f.foo.baz
import dependency # repin: dependency==1.0 Repin to version that works for all scripts
...

```

:::note
Windmill assumes that imports directly map to requirements,
however it is not always the case.
To handle this there is windmill import map.
And if you found a public python dependency that needs to be explicitly mapped you can submit an issue or [contribute](../../misc/4_contributing/index.md#mapping-python-imports).

#### PEP-723 inline script metadata

Windmill supports **PEP-723** inline script metadata, providing a standardized way to specify script dependencies and Python version requirements directly within your script. This implements the official Python packaging standard for inline script metadata.

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "requests",
#     "pandas>=1.0",
#     "numpy==1.21.0"
# ]
# ///

import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def main():
    response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/data")
    df = pd.DataFrame(response.json())
    return df.to_dict()
```

The PEP-723 format allows you to:
- Specify exact Python version requirements with `requires-python`
- List dependencies with version constraints in the `dependencies` array
- Use standard [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) version specifiers

**Python version shortcut**

For Python version requirements, Windmill also provides a convenient shortcut. Instead of using the full PEP-723 `requires-python` field, you can use the simple annotation format:

```python
#py: >=3.12

def main():
    return "Hello from Python 3.12+"
```

This shortcut is equivalent to specifying `requires-python = ">=3.12"` in the PEP-723 format.

### Private PyPI repository

Environment variables can be set to customize `uv`'s index-url and extra-index-url and certificate.
This is useful for private repositories.

In a docker-compose file, you would add following lines:

```dockerfile
windmill_worker:
  ...
  environment:
    ...
    # Completely whitelist pypi.org
    - PY_TRUSTED_HOST=pypi.org
    # or specificy path to custom certificate 
    - PY_INDEX_CERT=/custom-certs/root-ca.crt
```
:::note
UV is not using system certificates by default, if you wish to use them, set `PY_NATIVE_CERT=true`
:::


`UV index url` and `UV extra index url` are filled through Windmill UI, in [Instance settings](../18_instance_settings/index.mdx#registries) under [Enterprise Edition](/pricing).

![Private PyPI Repository](./private_pip.png 'Private PyPI Repository')

### Python runtime settings

For a given [worker group](../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx), you can add Python [runtime specific settings](../../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx#python-runtime-settings) like additional Python paths and PIP local dependencies.

### Select Python version

You can annotate the version of Python you would like to use for a script using the annotations like py310, py311, py312, or py313.
