# TypeScript client

The TypeScript client for Windmill allows you to interact with the Windmill platform using TypeScript in [Bun](https://bun.sh/) / [Deno](https://deno.land/) runtime. This client provides a set of functions and utilities to access Windmill resources and perform various operations.

The TypeScript Windmill SDK can be found at https://app.windmill.dev/tsdocs/modules.html

## Installation

To use the TypeScript client, you need to have Deno or Bun installed on your system. Follow the installation instructions from the official [Deno documentation](https://deno.land/manual@v1.36.1/getting_started/installation) or [Bun documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

Once Deno/Bun is installed, you can import the `windmill` module directly from the Deno third-party module registry.

<TabItem value="deno" label="TypeScript (Deno)" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```ts
import * as wmill from 'npm:windmill-client@1.318.0';
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bun" label="TypeScript (Bun)" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```ts
import * as wmill from 'windmill-client';
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Usage

The TypeScript client provides several functions that you can use to interact with the Windmill platform. Here's an example of how to use the client to get a resource from Windmill:

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
<TabItem value="deno" label="TypeScript (Deno)" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```ts
import * as wmill from 'npm:windmill-client@1.318.0';

export async function main() {
	let x = await wmill.getResource('u/user/name');
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bun" label="TypeScript (Bun)" attributes={{className: "text-xs p-4 !mt-0 !ml-0"}}>

```ts
import * as wmill from 'windmill-client@1.147.3';

export async function main() {
	let x = await wmill.getResource('u/user/name');
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the example above, the `getResource` function is used to retrieve a resource with the path `'u/user/name'` from the Windmill platform. The returned resource can be further processed or used as needed in your application.
