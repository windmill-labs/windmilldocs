# Code Editor

The code editor is Windmill's integrated development environment. It allows you to write code in [TypeScript](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/1_typescript_quickstart/index.mdx), [Python](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/2_python_quickstart/index.mdx), [Go](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/3_go_quickstart/index.mdx), [Bash](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/4_bash_quickstart/index.mdx), [SQL](../getting_started/0_scripts_quickstart/5_sql_quickstart/index.mdx), or even running any docker container through Windmill's Bash support.

The code editor is the main component for building scripts in Windmill's script editor, but it is also used in Windmill's [Flow Editor](../flows/1_flow_editor.mdx) to build steps or in the [App Editor](../apps/0_app_editor/index.mdx) to add inline scripts.
