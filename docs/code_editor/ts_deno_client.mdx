# TypeScript (Deno) Client

The TypeScript (Deno) client for Windmill allows you to interact with the Windmill platform using TypeScript in Deno runtime. This client provides a set of functions and utilities to access Windmill resources and perform various operations.

## Installation

To use the TypeScript (Deno) client, you need to have Deno installed on your system. Follow the Deno installation instructions from the official Deno website: [https://deno.land](https://deno.land)

Once Deno is installed, you can import the `windmill` module directly from the Deno third-party module registry.

```typescript
import * as wmill from 'https://deno.land/x/windmill/index.ts'
```

## Usage

The TypeScript (Deno) client provides several functions that you can use to interact with the Windmill platform. Here's an example of how to use the client to get a resource from Windmill:

```typescript
import * as wmill from 'https://deno.land/x/windmill/index.ts'

async function main(...) {
  let x = await wmill.getResource('u/user/name')
}
```

In the example above, the `getResource` function is used to retrieve a resource with the path `'u/user/name'` from the Windmill platform. The returned resource can be further processed or used as needed in your application.
