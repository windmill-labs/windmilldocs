# Image

The Image component allows you to upload and display an image. There are two options for the image upload: upload as base64 embedded image recommended for small images and upload to s3, which is recommended for larger images or if you have multiple images.

## Public app access for S3 images

You should sign s3 objects before passing them to the image component in a public app.
Learn more about it [here](../../core_concepts/38_object_storage_in_windmill/index.mdx#s3-object-signing-for-image-access-in-public-apps).
