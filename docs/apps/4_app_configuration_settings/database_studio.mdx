# Database Studio

This component allows you to create a database studio. The database studio is a web-based database management tool. It allows you to display and edit the content of a database. It uses Ag Grid to display the table.

## Features

- Display the content of a table.
- Edit the content of a table by directly editing the cells (only when the cell is editable).
- Add a new row: The form is automatically generated based on the column definitions, and the default values are automatically set. The form opens in a drawer.
- Delete a row: The delete button is displayed on the right of the row. The delete button is only displayed if the `Allow delete` property is set to true.

## Configuration

The component can be configured with the following properties:

- `resource`: The PostgreSQL resource to use.
- `table`: The table to use. Once the resource is selected, the list will be populated with the tables available in the database.

Once a resource is selected, you can explore the schema: It will open a drawer the schema of the database.

## Column definition

When the table is selected, the column definitions will automatically synchronise with the columns of the table.

The column can be configured with the following properties:

- `Skip for select and update`: By default, all columns are included in the select and update queries. If you want to exclude a column from the select and update queries, you can set this property to true. You cannot skip a primary key.

- `Hide from insert`: By default, all columns are used to generate the submit form. If you want to exclude a column from the submit form, you can set this property to true. If the column is not nullable or doesn't have a default value, a default value will be required.

- `Default input`: By default, all columns are used to generate the submit form. If you want to exclude a column from the submit form, you can set this property to true. If the column is not nullable or doesn't have a default value, a default value will be required.

- `Editable value`: Whether the value is editable. Is overriden by the `All editable` property on the table.

Furthermore, each column exposes the same configuration as the Ag Chart column definition.

## Table configuration

The database studio uses the same configuration as the Ag Chart, expect for the following property.

| Name         |  Type   | Connectable | Templatable | Default | Description                     |
| ------------ | :-----: | :---------: | :---------: | :-----: | ------------------------------- |
| Allow delete | boolean |    true     |    false    |  false  | Whether row deletion is enabled |
