# Runnables

On the bottom of the app editor, you can find the runnable editor. It allows you to create, edit or manage the scripts or flows linked to components (Runnable), and background scripts.

It holds the following items:

- Inline scripts: scripts that are defined on the app editor, linked to a component.
- Workspace/Hub: scripts linked to a component, but defined in the workspace or the Hub.
- Background scripts: scripts that are not linked to a component, but run in the background.
