# Schedule App Reports

Send a PDF or PNG preview of any app at a given [schedule](../core_concepts/1_scheduling/index.mdx). Enabling this feature will create a flow and a schedule in your workspace.

<br/>

For the flow to be executed, you need to set the WORKER_GROUP environment variable of one of your [workers](../core_concepts/9_worker_groups/index.mdx) to "reports" or add the tag "chromium" to one of your worker groups.

## Startup duration in seconds

Startup duration is the number of seconds to wait before capturing a preview to ensure that all startup scripts have been executed.

It can be defined manually.

## Screenshot kind

Whether you want the screenshot to be in pdf or png (useful for previews).

## Notification

Reports will be sent through a dedicated medium. Under [Cloud and Self-Hosted Enterprise plans](/pricing), screenshots can be sent through pre-set scripts to Slack (on your workspace's chosen [Slack resource](../integrations/slack.mdx)), [Discord](../integrations/discord.md), or Email ([SMTP](../integrations/smtp.md)). Otherwise, you can pick a custom script to handle the report.
