# Lazy mode

Lazy mode is a feature that allows you to lazy render components which is ideal for apps with many components where most are not directly visible to the user.

### Earger mode

In eager mode, all components will be fully initialized, even when they are not visible.

### Semi-lazy mode

In semi-lazy mode, components will be semi-initialized when hidden. That is the default mode.

### Lazy mode

When lazy mode is enabled, components are not rendered until they are needed. This can significantly improve the performance of your app, especially on mobile devices.

You can provide provide component ids to wait the initialization of before the initial refresh. e.g: `["a", "b"]`, no need to put background runnables ids.
