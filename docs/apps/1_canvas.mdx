# Canvas

The app canvas is the main area of the app editor. It displays the app components and allows you to configure them.
You can move and resize components and lock them to prevent them from being moved or resized by another component.

/>

The apps are defined by two layouts: `Mobile` and `Desktop`. The layout can be toggled from the toolbar. Layouts are independent and can be configured separately.

## Header

The header has the following elements:

- **Reload Button**: a reload button to manually reload the runnables that are triggerd on app load or refresh. It excludes the runnables that are triggered by click events for example.
- **Schedule Button**: a schedule button to schedule the app to reload periodically.
- **Hide bar on view**: When enabled, the app bar will be hidden when the app is viewed.
- **Author**: The scripts will be run on behalf of the author and a tight policy ensure security about the possible inputs of the runnables.

	id="component-moving"
	src="/videos/component-moving.mp4"
/>

### Resizing

Components can be resized by dragging the resize handler on the top-right corner of the component.

### Lock the position of a component

<video
	className="border-2 rounded-lg object-cover w-full h-full"
	autoPlay
	controls
	id="app-lock"
	src="/videos/app-lock.mp4"
/>

A locked component can't be moved or resized by another component. It can still be moved or resized by the user.

You can lock a component by clicking on the lock button on the top-right corner of the component.

:::tip

### Expand a component

Components can be expanded by clicking on the expand button on the top-right corner of the component. It will try to expand the component to take as much width as possible and at most 12 columns of height, taking into account the other components on the canvas.

	autoPlay

	id="component-expand"
	src="/videos/component-expand.mp4"

### Nesting components

Some components can be nested inside other components. For example, a `Button` component can be nested inside a `Container` component.
