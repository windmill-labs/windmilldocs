# Canvas

The app canvas is the main area of the app editor. It displays the app components and allows you to configure them.
You can move and resize components and lock them to prevent them from being moved or resized by another component.

The apps are defined by two layouts: `Mobile` and `Desktop`. The layout can be toggled from the toolbar. Layouts are independent and can be configured separately.

## Header

The header has the following elements:

- A reload button to reload the app.
- A schedule button to schedule the app.
- On behalf of: The user on behalf of which the app is running.
