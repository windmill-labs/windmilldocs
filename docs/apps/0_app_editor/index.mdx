# App Editor

The app editor is where you build an app with components, create interactions with runnables, and configure the app settings.

## Canvas

The canvas at the center of the editor is where you design and see the overall UI. Insert new components, move them around, resize them, or nest them in containers.

## Outputs

On the left panel of the editor, you can see the list of outputs of the app. These outputs represent the state of the app and are categorized into four types:

- **Context**: The context holds information such as the user email, username, workspace, query parameters, and more.
- **State**: The state holds the app's current state, which can be manipulated by the frontend scripts.
- **Component Outputs**: These outputs correspond to the outputs of the individual components.
- **Background Runnables**: These outputs represent the outputs of the background runnables.

![App Outputs](../../assets/apps/0_app_editor/app-outputs.png.webp)

You can perform the following actions with the outputs:

- Search for an output
- Edit the output's ID
- Select a component to view its outputs
- Connect an input to an output

## Runnables panel

On the bottom panel of the editor, you can see the list of runnables of the app. The runnables are the scripts or flows that are linked to components, or ran in the background. They are used to perform actions when a component is clicked, to fetch data, etc. They make all the interactions of the app.
