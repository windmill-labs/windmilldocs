# Toolbar

The app toolbar is present on the top of the app editor. It allows you to configure app settings, toggle preview (desktop/mobile) and debug runs.

### App summary

The app summary can be edited in left side of the toolbar. The app summary is used to describe the app and is visible in the app list.
The default summary is the app name.

### Undo/redo

The undo/redo buttons allow you to undo or redo the last action.

### Preview mode

The app editor mode can be toggled between `Editor` and `Preview` mode. The preview mode allows you to see the app in action.

### Desktop/mobile mode

Switch the canvas mode in `Mobile` or `Desktop` layout from the toolbar. You can manually set the position and size of the components in both modes.

### Menu `⋮`

The `⋮` menu allows you to access the following options:

- JSON: view the JSON representation of the app.
- Publish to Hub: publish the app to the Windmill Hub.
- Hub compatible JSON: view the JSON representation of the app in a format compatible with the Windmill Hub.

### App inputs configuration

The app inputs menu displays the list of all inputs of each component.
A toggle allows you to only display resources inputs, so you can easily configure your third-party resources of an app imported from the Hub, for example:

### Debug runs

The app builder allows you to have a look at latests runs to spot potential bugs.

### Publish

Publish the app as a standalone app, via an URL.
An app can be published in two ways:

- Read-access required: the app can be accessed by anyone who has read access to the app.
- Publish publicly: the app can be accessed by anyone knowing the secret URL. If set to `Publish publicly`, the secret url will be displayed here.

### Save

Save the app.

The first time you save the app, you will be asked to choose the owner of the app. You can either choose a user or a folder.

#### Owner: user

#### Owner: folder

Read and write permissions are given to groups and users at the folder level and shared by all items inside the folder.
