## App

An app is a collection of components. An app can be used to build a dashboard, a workflow, a form, a CRM, etc. An app is made of:

- **Components**: the components are the building blocks of an app. They can be used to display data, to perform actions, to create forms, etc. The components are displayed on a grid and can be nested in containers.
- **Runnables**: the runnables are the scripts or flows that are linked to components, or ran in the background. They are used to perform actions when a component is clicked, to fetch data, etc
