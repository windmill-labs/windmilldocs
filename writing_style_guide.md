# Writing style guide

This file contains writing style guidance when creating Windmill documentation. Review this guide before writing documentation.

## General writing style issues

### Overly marketing language

**Problem example:**
"Windmill can automatically fill your script and flow input forms using AI to save you time and effort. This intelligent feature analyzes your form parameters and can populate them with contextually appropriate values based on your requirements."

**Issues:**

- Too long and verbose for technical documentation
- Marketing language like "This intelligent feature" sounds promotional rather than technical
- Users prefer concise, direct explanations over flowery descriptions
- No backlinks to other pages of documentation

**Better approach:**

- Keep descriptions short and technical
- Focus on what the feature does and how to use it, not how "intelligent" or "smart" it is
- Use straightforward language: "Windmill can auto-fill [script](../script_editor/index.mdx) and [flow](../flows/flow_editor/index.mdx) inputs using AI" instead of verbose marketing copy
