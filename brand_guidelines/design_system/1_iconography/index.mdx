# Iconography

We use the **[Lucide icon library](https://lucide.dev/)** to ensure a consistent, modern, and lightweight visual language. Icons are line-only, aligning with our clean and technical aesthetic.

## Why Lucide?

Lucide provides consistent 2px stroke width, rounded joins, and professional quality across 1,000+ icons. All icons share the same 24x24 grid system and line-only style.

## Sizing

- **16px**: Table cells, compact interfaces
- **20px**: Form inputs, button icons
- **24px**: Navigation, primary actions
- **32px**: Feature highlights, empty states

## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do

- Use Lucide icons consistently throughout the interface
- Maintain the original 2px stroke width and style
- Use semantic colors from our color system
- Pair icons with text labels when possible
- Use standard sizes (16px, 20px, 24px, 32px)
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

### ❌ Don't

- Mix different icon libraries or styles
- Modify the stroke width or visual style
- Use icons as pure decoration without function
- Use icons alone for complex or uncommon actions
- Scale icons to arbitrary sizes
- Create custom icons unless absolutely necessary

Icons should enhance usability and clarity, not complicate the interface. When in doubt, prioritize clear text labels over icons alone.
