# Components

## Core Rules

### 1. Always Use the Component Library

**Never create custom components.** Use only the provided components from Windmill's library. If you need functionality that doesn't exist, request it from the design system team.

### 2. No Style Hacking

**Do not override component styles.** Components provide props for all supported variants and configurations. If you need a different appearance, use the appropriate prop variant.

```jsx
// ✅ Correct - use provided variants
<Button variant="primary" size="large">Submit</Button>

// ❌ Wrong - don't add custom styles
<Button class="bg-red-500 px-8">Submit</Button>
```

### 3. Check Guidelines First

**Always consult these component guidelines** before implementing. Each component section specifies:

- When to use each variant
- Proper implementation patterns
- Accessibility requirements
- Common mistakes to avoid

## Quick Reference

### Before You Code

1. Check if a component exists for your use case
2. Read the component's specific guidelines
3. Use only the documented props and variants
4. Test accessibility with keyboard navigation

| Component                     | When to Use                                         | Examples                                           |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **[Button.svelte](#buttons)** | User actions, form submissions, navigation triggers | Save, Cancel, Submit, Create, Edit, Delete         |
| **Toggle.svelte**             | Binary state changes, enable/disable features       | Dark mode, notifications, auto-save, feature flags |

## Buttons

Windmill uses **4 button types** with clear hierarchy. Each button type comes in 3 variants (text, icon+text, icon-only) and supports multiple states including hover, active, disabled, and selected (default and subtle only).

<ButtonShowcase />

**Button Hierarchy:**

- **Accent Secondary** (Highest Priority): Main conversion CTAs on landing pages - "Sign up", "Get started", "Download"
- **Accent** (High Priority): Most important action per view - "Save", "Submit", "Create" (only one per screen)
- **Default** (Standard Priority): Secondary actions and most UI interactions - "Cancel", "Edit", "Delete"
- **Subtle** (Low Priority): Tertiary actions in dense interfaces - toolbars, button groups

**Button States:**

- **Default**: Standard button appearance
- **Hover**: Interactive feedback when cursor hovers over button
- **Active/Pressed**: Visual feedback when button is clicked or pressed
- **Disabled**: Non-interactive state for unavailable actions
- **Selected**: Active selection state (available only for Default and Subtle variants)

**Usage Rules:**

- ✅ Use appropriate hierarchy, provide tooltips for icon-only buttons, test all states including disabled and selected
- ❌ Don't use multiple Accent buttons per view, use Accent Secondary outside marketing, create custom styles, or use selected state on Accent variants

## Form Components

Form components are currently being redesigned and will be documented here when ready.

## Implementation Notes

When implementing any component:

1. **Follow the design system**: Use only the components and variants documented here
2. **Accessibility first**: All components include built-in accessibility features
3. **Test thoroughly**: Verify functionality across different states and themes
4. **Ask questions**: When in doubt, consult the design system team before creating custom solutions
