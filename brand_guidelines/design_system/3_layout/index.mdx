# Layout

Our layout system ensures **consistency, clarity, and usability** across all interfaces. These guidelines establish standardized patterns for organizing content and interface elements.

## Form

Forms are fundamental building blocks of our application. They should be clear, efficient, and follow consistent patterns to reduce cognitive load and improve user experience.

### Design Principles

- **Predictable structure**: Consistent vertical hierarchy helps users scan and complete forms efficiently
- **Clear communication**: Every element serves a purpose in guiding users toward successful completion
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Use established patterns and clear visual hierarchy
- **Accessible by default**: Follow semantic HTML and proper labeling conventions

### Vertical Layout Guidelines

All form elements follow a consistent top-to-bottom hierarchy:

**Label → Description → Input → Validation/Hint**

This predictable order allows users to quickly understand what information is needed and how to provide it correctly.

### Spacing Guidelines

Use consistent spacing to create clear relationships between form elements:

- **4px gap (`gap-y-1`)** between all adjacent form elements:
  - Label to Description
  - Description to Input
  - Input to Validation/Hint

This tight, consistent spacing groups related elements while maintaining clear separation between form fields.

### Typography Guidelines

Follow our established [typography system](../../visual_identity/3_typography/index.mdx) for form elements:

#### Label

- **Style**: Body emphasized (`text-xs font-medium text-emphasis`)
- **Purpose**: Clearly identify what information is required
- **Example**: "Job name:", "Resource type:", "Environment variables:"

#### Description

- **Style**: Body (`text-xs font-normal text-secondary`)
- **Purpose**: Provide additional context or instructions
- **Example**: "Choose a descriptive name for your automation job"

#### Validation/Hint

- **Style**: Caption (`text-2xs font-normal text-hint`)
- **Purpose**: Guide users with requirements or feedback
- **Example**: "Required field", "Must be at least 8 characters", "Optional field"

### Writing Guidelines

#### Descriptions

- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Focus on the outcome or benefit, not the technical process
- Use sentence case and avoid unnecessary punctuation
- Example: ✅ "Choose the Python version for your script execution" vs ❌ "This dropdown allows you to select which Python version will be used when executing your script."

#### Helper Text and Hints

- Be specific about requirements upfront
- Use positive language when possible
- Provide examples for complex inputs
- Example: ✅ "Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only" vs ❌ "Invalid characters not allowed"

### Tooltip Usage

Use tooltips sparingly for **additional context** that would otherwise clutter the interface:

- Complex terminology or concepts that need definition
- Background information that helps with decision-making
- Links to relevant documentation or resources

**Don't use tooltips for**:

- Essential information needed to complete the form
- Error messages or validation feedback
- Basic instructions that should be in the description

### Visual Example

<ExampleImageDisplay
	lightImageSrc="/img/brand/layout/form-light.svg"
	darkImageSrc="/img/brand/layout/form-dark.svg"
	altTextPrefix="Form layout pattern showing proper hierarchy and spacing"
/>

The example above demonstrates:

- Clear label hierarchy using Body emphasized typography
- Concise description text using Body typography
- Proper input field styling
- Caption-styled hint text below the input

### Implementation Notes

- Always include proper semantic HTML (`<label>`, `<input>`, etc.)
- Associate labels with inputs using `for` attributes or wrapping
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's `gap-y-1` utility
- Test form layouts across different viewport sizes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all text elements
