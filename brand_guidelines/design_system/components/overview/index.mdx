# Components Overview

## Core Rules

### 1. Always Use the Component Library

**Never create custom components.** Use only the provided components from Windmill's library. If you need functionality that doesn't exist, request it from the design system team.

### 2. No Style Hacking

**Do not override component styles.** Components provide props for all supported variants and configurations. If you need a different appearance, use the appropriate prop variant.

```jsx
// ✅ Correct - use provided variants
<Button variant="primary" size="large">Submit</Button>

// ❌ Wrong - don't add custom styles
<Button class="bg-red-500 px-8">Submit</Button>
```

### 3. Check Guidelines First

**Always consult these component guidelines** before implementing. Each component page specifies:

- When to use each variant
- Proper implementation patterns
- Accessibility requirements
- Common mistakes to avoid

## Available Components

- **[Buttons](./buttons/)**: Primary, secondary, and destructive actions
- **[Form Components](./form_components/)**: Inputs, selects, and form patterns

## Quick Reference

### Before You Code

1. Check if a component exists for your use case
2. Read the component's specific guidelines
3. Use only the documented props and variants
4. Test accessibility with keyboard navigation
