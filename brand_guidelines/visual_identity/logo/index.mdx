# Logo

The Windmill logo represents a windmill with sharp blades, a reference to the first automation in history. The two colors emulate the constant movement of the windmill, conveying **motion, efficiency, and reliability**.

## Logo Philosophy

The Windmill logo embodies our core values:

- **Automation**: Like a windmill harnesses wind power, Windmill harnesses workflow automation
- **Efficiency**: Continuous rotation represents streamlined, optimized processes
- **Reliability**: Solid, geometric construction conveys stability and dependability
- **Innovation**: Modern interpretation of a classic symbol bridges tradition with technology

## Logo Variants

We provide multiple logo variants to ensure optimal display across different contexts and backgrounds.

### Primary Variant

**When to use:** The primary variant is the preferred logo choice for most applications.

- **Primary**: Use on light backgrounds, white surfaces, and light-colored layouts

### Secondary Variants

**When to use:** Secondary variants provide contrast on dark backgrounds or when the primary logo doesn't have sufficient contrast.

- **Secondary (Dark)**: Use on dark backgrounds, colored surfaces, and dark-themed interfaces
- **Secondary (Light)**: Use on light backgrounds when you need a subtle, monochromatic appearance

## Logo Animation

The windmill logo is designed to rotate **clockwise** when animated. This direction reinforces the natural movement of wind-powered generators and suggests forward progress.

### Animation Guidelines

- **Direction**: Always rotate clockwise
- **Speed**: Smooth, moderate rotation (not too fast to be distracting)
- **Usage**: Use sparingly for loading states, success animations, or brand moments
- **Duration**: 2-4 seconds per full rotation for optimal visual effect

## Usage Guidelines

### Logo Sizing

**Minimum sizes:**

- Digital: 16px height minimum
- Print: 0.5 inch (12.7mm) height minimum
- Favicon: 16px x 16px (use simplified version if needed)

**Optimal sizes:**

- Website headers: 32-48px height
- App interfaces: 24-32px height
- Marketing materials: 48px+ height
- Large displays: Scale proportionally

### Clear Space

Maintain clear space around the logo equal to the height of one windmill blade. This ensures the logo has proper visual breathing room and maintains its impact.

**Clear space = 0.25x logo height on all sides**

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center', margin: '24px 0' }}>
